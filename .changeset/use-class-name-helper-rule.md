Added the `useClassNameHelper` nursery lint rule for JSX. It flags interpolated template literals in class attributes and supports configurable `attributes` and `helperFunctions` options to allow project-specific class helper patterns. See discussion [#8652](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/discussions/8652).
