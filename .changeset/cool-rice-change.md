"@biomejs/biome": patch
---

Added the assist action [`organizePackageJson`](https://biomejs.dev/assist/actions/organize-package-json/).

This action organizes package.json fields according to the same conventions as the popular [sort-package-json](https://github.com/keithamus/sort-package-json) tool.
