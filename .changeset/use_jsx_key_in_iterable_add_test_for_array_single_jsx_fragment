Added test for invalid scenario reported here [`Incorrect lint/correctness/useJsxKeyInIterable in array assignments`](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/4981)

The reported Invalid case:

```jsx
const Valid = [<>
  <p>Test 1</p>
  <p>Test 2</p>
</>]
```

Is actually valid now.

So the scope of the change is to just add a test for that.
