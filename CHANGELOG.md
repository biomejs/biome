# Biome changelog

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Due to the nature of Biome as a toolchain,
it can be unclear what changes are considered major, minor, or patch.
Read our [guidelines to categorize a change](https://biomejs.dev/internals/versioning).

New entries must be placed in a section entitled `Unreleased`.

## 1.6.2 (2024-03-22)

### Analyzer

#### Bug fixes

- The `noSuperWithoutExtends` rule now allows for calling `super()` in derived class constructors of class expressions ([#2108](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2108)). Contributed by @Sec-ant

- Smoother handling of `"endOfLine": "auto"` in prettier migration: falling back to `"lf"` ([#2145](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2145)). Contributed by @eMerzh

### Configuration

#### Bug fixes

- Fix enabled rules calculation. The precendence of individual rules, `all` and `recommend` presets in top-level and group-level configs is now correctly respected. More details can be seen in ([#2072](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/2072)) ([#2028](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2028)). Contributed by @Sec-ant

  for use of the done argument, suggesting you return a promise instead. Contributed by @vasucp1207

  ```js
  beforeEach(done => {
    // ...
  });
  ```

#### Bug fixes

- [useJsxKeyInIterable](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-jsx-key-in-iterable) now recognizes function bodies wrapped in parentheses ([#2011](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2011)). Contributed by @Sec-ant

- [useShorthandFunctionType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-shorthand-function-type) now preserves type parameters of generic interfaces when applying fixes ([#2015](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2015)). Contributed by @Sec-ant

- Code fixes of [useImportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-type) and [useExportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-export-type) now handle multiline statements ([#2041](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2041)). Contributed by @Conaclos

- [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare) no longer reports type parameter and parameter with identical names ([#1992](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1992)).

  The following code is no longer reported:

  ```ts
  function f<a>(a: a) {}
  ```

  Contributed by @Conaclos

- [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare) now reports duplicate type parameters in a same declaration.

  The following type parameters are now reported as a redeclaraion:

  ```ts
  function f<T, T>() {}
  ```

  Contributed by @Conaclos

- [noUndeclaredDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-dependencies/) now recognizes imports of subpath exports.

  E.g., the following import statements no longer report errors if `@mui/material` and `tailwindcss` are installed as dependencies:

  ```ts
  import Button from "@mui/material/Button";
  import { fontFamily } from "tailwindcss/defaultTheme";
  ```

  Contributed by @Sec-ant

### Parser

#### Bug fixes

- JavaScript lexer is now able to lex regular expression literals with escaped non-ascii chars ([#1941](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1941)).

  Contributed by @Sec-ant

## 1.6.0 (2024-03-08)

### Analyzer

#### New features

- Add partial for `.astro` files. Biome is able to sort imports inside the frontmatter of the Astro files. Contributed
  by @ematipico

  ```diff
  ---
  - import { getLocale } from "astro:i18n";
  - import { Code } from "astro:components";
  + import { Code } from "astro:components";
  + import { getLocale } from "astro:i18n";
  ---

  <div></div>
  ```
- Add partial for `.vue` files. Biome is able to sort imports inside the script block of Vue files. Contributed by
  @nhedger

  ```diff
  <script setup lang="ts">
  - import Button from "./components/Button.vue";
  - import * as vueUse from "vue-use";
  + import * as vueUse from "vue-use";
  + import Button from "./components/Button.vue";
  </script/>

  <template></template>
  ```

- Add partial for `.svelte` files. Biome is able to sort imports inside the script block of Svelte files. Contributed by
  @ematipico

  ```diff
  <script setup lang="ts">
  - import Button from "./components/Button.svelte";
  - import * as svelteUse from "svelte-use";
  + import * as svelteUse from "svelte-use";
  + import Button from "./components/Button.svelte";
  </script/>

  <div></div>
  ```

- Add lint rule useJsxKeyInIterable from Eslint rule [`react/jsx-key`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-key.md). Contributed by @vohoanglong0107
- The analyzer now **infers** the correct quote from `javascript.formatter.quoteStyle`, if set. This means that code fixes suggested by the analyzer will use the same quote of the formatter. Contributed by @ematipico

#### Enhancements

- [noUnusedVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-variables) ignores unused rest spread silbings.

  The following code is now valid:

  ```js
  const { a, ...rest } = { a: 0, b: 1 };
  console.log(rest);
  ```

  Contributed by @ah-yu

- Fix [#1931](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1931). Built-in React hooks such as
  `useEffect()` can now be validated by the
  [`useExhaustiveDependendies`](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies/), even
  when they're not being imported from the React library. To do so, simply configure them like
  any other user-provided hooks.

  Contributed by @arendjr

- Implemented [#1128](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1128). User-provided React hooks can
  now be configured to track stable results. For example:

  ```json
  "useExhaustiveDependencies": {
      "level": "error",
      "options": {
          "hooks": [{
              "name": "useMyState",
              "stableResult": [
                  1
              ]
          }]
      }
  }
  ```

  This will allow the following to be validated:

  ```js
  const [myState, setMyState] = useMyState();
  const toggleMyState = useCallback(() => {
    setMyState(!myState);
  }, [myState]); // Only `myState` needs to be specified here.
  ```

  Contributed by @arendjr

#### Bug fixes

- Fix [#1748](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1748). Now for the following case we won't provide an unsafe fix
  for the `noNonNullAssertion` rule:

  ```ts
  x[y.z!];
  ```

  Contributed by @ah-yu

- Imports that contain the protocol `:` are now sorted after the `npm:` modules, and before the `URL` modules.
  Contributed by @ematipico

  ```diff
  import express from "npm:express";
  - import Component from "./component.js"
  - import { sortBy } from "virtual:utils";
  + import { sortBy } from "virtual:utils";
  + import Component from "./component.js"
  ```

- Fix [#1081](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1081). The `useAwait` rule does not report `for await...of`.
  Contributed by @unvalley

- Fix [#1827](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1827) by properly analyzing nested `try-finally` statements. Contributed by @ah-yu

- Fix [#1924](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1924) Use the correct export name to sort in the import clause. Contributed by @ah-yu
- Fix [#1805](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1805) fix formatting arrow function which has conditional expression body  Contributed by @mdm317

- Fix [#1781](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1781) by avoiding the retrieval of the entire static member expression for the reference if the static member expression does not start with the reference. Contributed by @ah-yu

### CLI

#### New features

- Add a new command `biome migrate prettier`. The command will read the file `.prettierrc`/`prettier.json`
  and `.prettierignore` and map its configuration to Biome's one.
  Due to the different nature of `.prettierignore` globs and Biome's globs, it's **highly** advised to make sure that
  those still work under Biome.

- Now the file name printed in the diagnostics is clickable. If you run the CLI from your editor, you can <kbd>
  Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd title="Cmd">⌘</kbd> + Click on the file name, and the editor will open said file. If row and columns
  are specified e.g. `file.js:32:7`, the editor will set the cursor right in that position. Contributed by @ematipico

- Add an option `--linter` to `biome rage`. The option needs to check Biome linter configuration. Contributed by
  @seitarof

- Add an option `--formatter` to `biome rage`. The option needs to check Biome formatter configuration. Contributed by
  @seitarof
- The CLI now consistently reports the number of files tha were changed, out of the total files that were analysed. Contributed by @ematipico
- The CLI now consistently shows the number of errors and warnings emitted. Contributed by @ematipico

#### Bug fixes

- Don't process files under an ignored directory.

  Previously, Biome processed all files in the traversed hierarchy,
  even the files under an ignored directory.
  Now, it completely skips the content of ignored directories.

  For now, directories cannot be ignored using `files.include` in the configuration file.
  This is a known limitation that we want to address in a future release.

  For instance, if you have a project with a folder `src` and a folder `test`,
  the following configuration doesn't completely ignore `test`.

  ```json
  {
    "files": {
      "include": ["src"]
    }
  }
  ```

  Biome will traverse `test`,
  however all files of the directory are correctly ignored.
  This can result in file system errors,
  if Biome encounters dangling symbolic links or files with higher permissions.

  To avoid traversing the `test` directory,
  you should ignore the directory using `ignore`:

  ```json
  {
    "files": {
      "include": ["src"],
      "ignore": ["test"]
    }
  }
  ```

- Fix [#1508](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1508) by excluding deleted files from being processed. Contributed
  by @ematipico

- Fix [#1173](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1173). Fix the formatting of a single instruction with commented
  in a control flow body to ensure consistency. Contributed by @mdm317

- Fix overriding of `javascript.globals`. Contributed by @arendjr
- Fix a bug where syntax rules weren't run when pulling the diagnostics. Now Biome will emit more parsing diagnostics,
  e.g.
  ```
  check.js:1:17 parse/noDuplicatePrivateClassMembers ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    × Duplicate private class member "#foo"

    > 1 │ class A { #foo; #foo }
        │                 ^^^^

  ```
  Contributed by @ematipico
- Fix [#1774](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1774) by taking into account the option `--no-errors-on-unmatched` when running the CLI using `--changed`. Contributed by @antogyn

#### Enhancements

- Removed a superfluous diagnostic that was printed during the linting/check phase of a file:

  ```
  test.js check ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    × The file contains diagnostics that needs to be addressed.
  ```
  Contributed by @ematipico
- The command `format` now emits parsing diagnostics if there are any, and it will terminate with a non-zero exit code. Contributed by @ematipico

### Configuration

#### New features

- Add the ability to resolve the configuration files defined inside `extends` from the `node_modules/` directory.

  If you want to resolve a configuration file that matches the specifier `@org/configs/biome`, then your `package.json`
  file must look this:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "@org/configs",
    "exports": {
      "./biome": "./biome.json"
    }
  }
  ```

  And the `biome.json` file that "imports" said configuration, will look like this:
  ```json
  {
    "extends": "@org/configs/biome"
  }
  ```
  Read the [documentation](https://biomejs.dev/guides/how-biome-works#the-extends-option) to better understand how it
  works, expectations and restrictions.

### Editors

#### Bug fixes

- Fix a regression where ignored files where formatted in the editor. Contributed by @ematipico
- Fix a bug where syntax rules weren't run when pulling the diagnostics. Now Biome will emit more parsing diagnostics,
  e.g.
  ```
  check.js:1:17 parse/noDuplicatePrivateClassMembers ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    × Duplicate private class member "#foo"

    > 1 │ class A { #foo; #foo }
        │                 ^^^^

  ```
  Contributed by @ematipico

### Formatter

#### New features

- Biome now allows to format the `package.json` file. This is now the default behaviour and users can remove their
  workarounds.
  If you rely on other tools to format `package.json`, you'll have to ignore it via configuration. Contributed by
  @pattrickrice
- New formatter option `attributePosition` that have similar behavior as
  Prettier `singleAttributePerLine` [#1706](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1706). Contributed by @octoshikari
- Add partial for `.astro` files. Biome is able to format the frontmatter of the Astro files. Contributed by @ematipico

  ```diff
  ---
  - statement ( );
  + statement();
  ---

  <div></div>
  ```
- Add partial for `.vue` files. Biome is able to format the script block of Vue files. Contributed by @nhedger

  ```diff
  <script setup lang="ts">
  - statement ( );
  + statement();
  </script/>

  <template></template>
  ```

- Add partial for `.svelte` files. Biome is able to format the script block of Svelte files. Contributed by @ematipico

  ```diff
  <script setup lang="ts">
  - statement ( );
  + statement();
  </script/>

  <div></div>
  ```

#### Enhancements

- `composer.json`, `deno.json`, `jsconfig.json`, `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` are no longer protected files.

  This means that you can now format them.

  If you want to ignore these files, you can use the [files.ignore](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesignore) configuration:

  ```json
  {
    "files": {
      "ignore": [
        "composer.json",
        "jsconfig.json",
        "package.json",
        "tsconfig.json",
        "typescript.json",
        "deno.json",
        "deno.jsonc"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

  The following files are still protected, and thus ignored:

  - `composer.lock`
  - `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `yarn.lock`

   Contributed by @pattrickrice and @Conaclos

#### Bug fixes

- Fix [#1039](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1039). Check unicode width instead of number of bytes when
  checking if regex expression is a simple argument.

  This no longer breaks.

  ```js
  s(/🚀🚀/).s().s();
  ```

   Contributed by @kalleep

- Fix [#1218](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1218), by correctly preserving empty lines in member chains.
  Contributed by @ah-yu
- Fix [#1659](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1659) and [#1662](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1662), by correctly taking into account the leading comma inside the formatter options. Contributed by @ematipico

- Fix [#1934](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1934). Fix invalid formatting of long arrow function for AsNeeded arrow parens Contributed by @fireairforce

  Contributed by @DaniGuardiola

- Add rule [noUndeclaredependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-dependencies), to detect the use of
  dependencies that aren't present in the `package.json`.

  The rule ignores imports using a protocol such as `node:`, `bun:`, `jsr:`, `https:`.

  Contributed by @ematipico and @Conaclos

- Add rule [noNamespaceImport](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-namespace-import), to report namespace imports:

  ```js
  import * as foo from "foo";
  ```
  Contributed by @unvalley
- Add partial support for `.astro` files. Biome is able to lint and fix the frontmatter of the Astro files. Contributed
  by @ematipico

  ```diff
  ---
  - delete a.b
  + a.b = undefined
  ---

  <div></div>
  ```

- Add partial support for `.vue` files. Biome is able to lint and fix the script block of the Vue files.

  ```diff
  <script setup lang="ts">
  - delete a.b
  + a.b = undefined
  <script>

  <template></template>
  ```

  Contributed by @nhedger

- Add rule [useNodeAssertStrict](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-node-assert-strict), which promotes the use
  of `node:assert/strict` over `node:assert`. Contributed by @ematipico

- Add rule [noExportsInTest](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-exports-in-test) which disallows `export` or `modules.exports` in files

    return (
      <div>
        <div />;
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  Contributed by @fujiyamaorange
- Add rule [noBarrelFile](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-barrel-file), to report the usage of barrel file:

  ```js
  export * from "foo";
  ```
  Contributed by @togami2864

#### Enhancements

- [noUselessFragments](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-fragments/) now rule not triggered for jsx attributes when
   the fragment child is simple text.

  ```js
  export function SomeComponent() {
    return <div x-some-prop={<>Foo</>} />;
  }
  ```

   Also fixes code action when the fragment child is of type `JsxExpressionChild`.

  ```js

- [useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention) now
  supports [unicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicase)
  letters ([#1786](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1786)).

  [unicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicase) letters have a single case: they are neither uppercase nor lowercase.
  Previously, Biome reported names in unicase as invalid.
  It now accepts a name in unicase everywhere.

  The following code is now accepted:

  ```js
  const 안녕하세요 = { 안녕하세요: 0 };
  ```

  We still reject a name that mixes unicase characters with lowercase or uppercase characters:
  The following names are rejected:

  ```js
  const A안녕하세요 = { a안녕하세요: 0 };
  ```

- [useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention)
  and [useFilenamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-filenaming-convention) now provides a new option `requireAscii` to require identifiers to
  be in ASCII.

  To avoid any breaking change, this option is turned off by default.
  We intend to turn it on in the next major release of Biome (Biome 2.0).

  Set the `requireAscii` rule option to `true` to require identifiers to be in ASCII.

  ```json
  {
    "linter": {
      "rules": {
        "style": {

#### Bug fixes

- Override correctly the recommended preset ([#1349](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1349)).

  Previously, if unspecified, Biome turned on the recommended preset in overrides.
  This resulted in reporting diagnostics with a severity level set to `off`.
  This in turn caused Biome to fail.

  Now Biome won't switch on the recommended preset in `overrides` unless told to do so.

- Fix [#1512](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1512) by skipping verbose diagnostics from the count. Contributed
  by @ematipico

- Correctly handle cascading `include` and `ignore`.

  Previously Biome incorrectly included files that were included at tool level and ignored at global level.
  In the following example, `file.js` was formatted when it should have been ignored.
  Now, Biome correctly ignores the directory `./src/sub/`.

  ```shell
  ❯ tree src
    src
    └── sub
        └── file.js

  ❯ cat biome.json

- Don't emit verbose warnings when a protected file is ignored.

  Some files, such as `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`,
  are [protected](https://biomejs.dev/guides/how-biome-works/#protected-files).
  Biome emits a verbose warning when it encounters a protected file.

  Previously, Biome emitted this verbose warning even if the file was ignored by the configuration.
  Now, it doesn't emit verbose warnings for protected files that are ignored.

  clauses or in a `new` expression. Contributed by @Conaclos

  These cases require the presence of a prototype.

- Add dependency variable names on error message when useExhaustiveDependencies rule shows errors. Contributed by
  @mehm8128

#### Bug fixes

- The fix of [useArrowFunction](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-arrow-function) now adds parentheses around the
  arrow function in more cases where it is needed ([#1524](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1524)).

  A function expression doesn't need parentheses in most expressions where it can appear.
  This is not the case with the arrow function.
  We previously added parentheses when the function appears in a call or member expression.
  We now add parentheses in binary-like expressions and other cases where they are needed, hopefully covering all cases.

  Previously:

  ```diff
  - f = f ?? function() {};
  + f = f ?? () => {};
  ```

  Now:

  ```diff
  - f = f ?? function() {};
  + f = f ?? (() => {});

Now, the rule wraps any comma sequence between parentheses:

```diff

  list** globs of files using the `!` character:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "files": {
      "ignore": [
        "node_modules/**",
        "!**/dist/**" // this is now accepted and allow files inside the `dist` folder
      ]
    }
  }

#### Promoted rules

New rules are incubated in the nursery group.
Once stable, we promote them to a stable group.
The following rules are promoted:

- [a11y/noAriaHiddenOnFocusable](https://www.biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-aria-hidden-on-focusable)
- [a11y/useValidAriaRole](https://www.biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-valid-aria-role)
- [complexity/useRegexLiterals](https://www.biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-regex-literals)
- [suspicious/noImplicitAnyLet](https://www.biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-implicit-any-let)
- [style/noDefaultExport](https://www.biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-default-export)

#### New features

- Add [useExportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-export-type) that enforces the use of type-only exports for
  types. Contributed by @Conaclos

  ```diff
    interface A {}
    interface B {}
    class C {}

  - export type { A, C }
  + export { type A, C }

  - export { type B }
  + export type { B }
  ```

- Add [useImportType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-type) that enforces the use of type-only imports for
  types. Contributed by @Conaclos

  ```diff
  - import { A, B } from "./mod.js";
  + import { type A, B } from "mod";
    let a: A;
    const b: B = new B();
  ```

  Also, the rule groups type-only imports:

  ```diff
  - import { type A, type B } from "./mod.js";
  + import type { A, B } from "./mod.js";
  ```

- Add [useFilenamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-filenaming-convention), that enforces naming
  conventions for JavaScript and TypeScript filenames. Contributed by @Conaclos

  By default, the rule requires that a filename be in `camelCase`, `kebab-case`, `snake_case`, or matches the name of
  an `export` in the file.
  The rule provides options to restrict the allowed cases.

- Add [useNodejsImportProtocol](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-nodejs-import-protocol) that enforces the use of
  the `node:` protocol when importing _Node.js_ modules. Contributed by @2-NOW, @vasucp1207, and @Conaclos

  ```diff
  - import fs from "fs";
  + import fs from "node:fs";
  ```

- Add [useNumberNamespace](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-number-namespace) that enforces the use of the `Number`
  properties instead of the global ones.

  ```diff
  - parseInt;
  + Number.parseInt;
  - - Infinity;
  + Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
  ```

- Add [useShorthandFunctionType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-shorthand-function-type) that enforces using
  function types instead of object type with call signatures. Contributed by @emab, @ImBIOS, and @seitarof

  ```diff
  - interface Example {
  -   (): string;
  - }
  + type Example = () => string

```

- Add [noNodejsModules](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-nodejs-modules), that disallows the use of _Node.js_ modules. Contributed by @anonrig, @ematipico, and @Conaclos

- Add [noInvalidUseBeforeDeclaration](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-invalid-use-before-declaration) that reports variables and function parameters used before their declaration. Contributed by @Conaclos

  ```js
  function f() {
    console.log(c); // Use of `c` before its declaration.
    const c = 0;
  }
  ```

- Add [useConsistentArrayType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-consistent-array-type) that enforces the use of a
  consistent syntax for array types. Contributed by @eryue0220

  This rule will replace [useShorthandArrayType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-shorthand-array-type).
  It provides an option to choose between the shorthand or the generic syntax.

- Add [noEmptyTypeParameters](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-empty-type-parameters) that ensures that any type
  parameter list has at least one type parameter. Contributed by @togami2864

  This will report the following empty type parameter lists:

  ```ts
  interface Foo<> {}
  //           ^^
  type Bar<> = {};
  //      ^^
  ```

- Add [noGlobalEval](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-global-eval) that reports any use of the global `eval`.
  Contributed by @you-5805

- Add [noGlobalAssign](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-global-assign) that reports assignment to global variables.
  Contributed by @chansuke

  ```js
  Object = {}; // report assignment to `Object`.
  ```

- Add [noMisleadingCharacterClass](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-misleading-character-class) that disallows
  characters made with multiple code points in character class. Contributed by @togami2864

- Add [noThenProperty](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-then-property) that disallows the use of `then` as property
  name. Adding a `then` property makes an object _thenable_ that can lead to errors with Promises. Contributed by
  @togami2864

- Add [noUselessTernary](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-ternary) that disallows conditional expressions (
  ternaries) when simpler alternatives exist.

  ```js
  var a = x ? true : true; // this could be simplified to `x`
  ```

#### Enhancements

- [noEmptyInterface](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-empty-interface) ignores empty interfaces that extend a type.
  Address [#959](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/959) and [#1157](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1157).
  Contributed by @Conaclos

  This allows supporting interface augmentation in external modules as demonstrated in the following example:

  ```ts
  interface Extension {
    metadata: unknown;
  }

  declare module "@external/module" {
    // Empty interface that extends a type.
    export interface ExistingInterface extends Extension {}
  }
  ```

- Preserve more comments in the code fix
  of [useExponentiationOperator](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exponentiation-operator). Contributed by @Conaclos

  The rule now preserves comments that follow the (optional) trailing comma.

  For example, the rule now suggests the following code fix:

  ```diff
  - Math.pow(
  -    a, // a
  -    2, // 2
  -  );
  +
  +    a ** // a
  +    2 // 2
  +
  ```

- `<svg>` element is now considered as a non-interactive HTML
  element ([#1095](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1095)). Contributed by @chansuke

  This affects the following rules:
  - [noAriaHiddenOnFocusable](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-aria-hidden-on-focusable)
  - [noInteractiveElementToNoninteractiveRole](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-interactive-element-to-noninteractive-role)
  - [noNoninteractiveElementToInteractiveRole](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-noninteractive-element-to-interactive-role)
  - [noNoninteractiveTabindex](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-noninteractive-tabindex)
  - [useAriaActivedescendantWithTabindex](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-aria-activedescendant-with-tabindex)

- [noMultipleSpacesInRegularExpressionLiterals](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-multiple-spaces-in-regular-expression-literals/)
  has a safe code fix. Contributed by @Conaclos

- [useArrowFunction](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-arrow-function/) ignores expressions that use `new.target`.
  Contributed by @Conaclos

- [noForEach](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-for-each) now reports only calls that use a callback with `0` or `1`
  parameter. Address [#547](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/547). Contributed by @Conaclos

#### Bug fixes

-
Fix [#1061](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1061). [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare)
no longer reports overloads of `export default function`. Contributed by @Conaclos

The following code is no longer reported:

```ts
export default function(a: boolean): boolean;
export default function(a: number): number;
export default function(a: number | boolean): number | boolean {
  return a;
}
```

-
Fix [#651](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/651), [useExhaustiveDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies)
no longer reports out of scope dependencies. Contributed by @kalleep

The following code is no longer reported:
```ts
let outer = false;

const Component = ({}) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    outer = true;
  }, []);
}
```

-
Fix [#1191](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1191). [noUselessElse](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-else)
now preserve comments of the `else` clause. Contributed by @Conaclos

For example, the rule suggested the following fix:

```diff
  function f(x) {
    if (x <0) {
      return 0;
    }
-   // Comment
-   else {
      return x;
-   }
  }
```

Now the rule suggests a fix that preserves the comment of the `else` clause:

```diff
  function f(x) {
    if (x <0) {
      return 0;
    }
    // Comment
-   else {
      return x;
-   }
  }
```

-
Fix [#1383](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1383). [noConfusingVoidType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-confusing-void-type)
now accepts the `void` type in type parameter lists.

The rule no longer reports the following code:

```ts
f<void>();
```

-
Fix [#728](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/728). [useSingleVarDeclarator](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-single-var-declarator)
no longer outputs invalid code. Contributed by @Conaclos

-
Fix [#1167](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1167). [useValidAriaProps](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-valid-aria-props)
no longer reports `aria-atomic` as invalid. Contributed by @unvalley

-
Fix [#1192](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1192). [useTemplate](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-template/)
now correctly handles parenthesized expressions and respects type coercions. Contributed by @n-gude

These cases are now properly handled:

```js
"a" + (1 + 2) // `a${1 + 2}`
```

```js
1 + (2 + "a") // `${1}${2}a`
```

-
Fix [#1456](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1456). [useTemplate](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-template/)
now reports expressions with an interpolated template literal and non-string expressions. Contributed by @n-gude

The following code is now reported:

```js
`a${1}` + 2;
```

-
Fix [#1436](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1436). [useArrowFunction](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-arrow-function/)
now applies a correct fix when a function expression is used in a call expression or a member access. Contributed by
@Conaclos

For example, the rule proposed the following fix:

```diff
- const called = function() {}();
+ const called = () => {}();
```

It now proposes a fix that adds the needed parentheses:

```diff
- const called = function() {}();
+ const called = (() => {})();
```

-
Fix [#696](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/696). [useHookAtTopLevel](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-hook-at-top-level)
now correctly detects early returns before the calls to the hook.

- The code fix of [noUselessTypeCOnstraint](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-type-constraint) now adds a
  trailing comma when needed to disambiguate a type parameter list from a JSX element. COntributed by @Conaclos

-
Fix [#578](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/578). [useExhaustiveDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies)
now correctly recognizes hooks namespaced under the `React` namespace. Contributed by @XiNiHa

-
Fix [#910](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/910). [noSvgWithoutTitle](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-svg-without-title)
now ignores `<svg>` element with `aria-hidden="true"`. COntributed by @vasucp1207

### Parser

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- The representation of imports has been simplified. Contributed by @Conaclos

  The new representation is closer to the ECMAScript standard.
  It provides a single way of representing a namespace import such as `import * as ns from ""`.
  It rules out some invalid states that was previously representable.
  For example, it is no longer possible to represent a combined import with a `type` qualifier such
  as `import type D, { N } from ""`.

  See [#1163](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1163) for more details.

#### New features

- Imports and exports with both an _import attribute_ and a `type` qualifier are now reported as parse errors.

  ```ts
  import type A from "mod" with { type: "json" };
  //     ^^^^              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  //     parse error
  ```

#### Bug fixes

- Fix [#1077](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1077) where parenthesized identifiers in conditional expression
  were being parsed as arrow expressions. Contributed by @kalleep

  These cases are now properly parsed:

  _JavaScript_:

  ```javascript
    a ? (b) : a => {};
  ```

  _TypeScript_:

  ```ts
    a ? (b) : a => {};
  ```

  _JSX_:

  ```jsx
    bar ? (foo) : (<a>{() => {}}</a>);
  ```

- Allow empty type parameter lists for interfaces and type
  aliases ([#1237](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1237)). COntributed by @togami2864

  _TypeScript_ allows interface declarations and type aliases to have empty type parameter lists.
  Previously Biome didn't handle this edge case.
  Now, it correctly parses this syntax:

  ```ts
  interface Foo<> {}
  type Bar<> = {};
  ```

### Crates

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- Rename the `biome_js_unicode_table` crate
  to `biome_unicode_table` ([#1302](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1302)). COntributed by @chansuke

## 1.4.1 (2023-11-30)

### Editors

#### Bug fixes

- Fix [#933](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/933). Some files are properly ignored in the LSP too.
  E.g. `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.
- Fix [#1394](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1394), by inferring the language extension from the internal saved
  files. Now newly created files JavaScript correctly show diagnostics.

### Formatter

#### Bug fixes

  Contributed by @faultyserver

### Linter

#### Bug fixes

- Fix [#910](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/910), where the rule `noSvgWithoutTitle` should skip elements that
  have `aria-hidden` attributes. Contributed by @vasucp1207

#### New features

- Add [useForOf](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-for-of) rule.
  The rule recommends a for-of loop when the loop index is only used to read from an array that is being iterated.
  Contributed by @victor-teles

#### Enhancement

- Address [#924](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/924)
  and [#920](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/920). [noUselessElse](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-else)
  now ignores `else` clauses that follow at least one `if` statement that doesn't break early. Contributed by @Conaclos

  For example, the following code is no longer reported by the rule:

  ```js
  function f(x) {
      if (x < 0) {
        // this `if` doesn't break early.
      } else if (x > 0) {
          return x;
      } else {
          // This `else` block was previously reported as useless.
      }
  }
  ```

  made [noConfusingVoidType](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-confusing-void-type) report false positives when
  the `void` type is used in a generic type parameter. Contributed by @unvalley

### CLI

#### Bug fixes

- Fix how `overrides` behave. Now `ignore` and `include` apply or not the override pattern, so they override each other.
  Now the options inside `overrides` override the top-level options.
- Bootstrap the logger only when needed. Contributed by @ematipico

  of `check --apply-unsafe`.

- Import sorting now handles Bun imports `bun:<name>`, absolute path imports `/<path>`,
  and [Node's subpath imports `#<name>`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports).
  See [our documentation](https://biomejs.dev/analyzer/) for more details. Contributed by @Conaclos

- Add option `--daemon-logs` to `biome rage`. The option is required to view Biome daemon server logs. Contributed by
  @unvalley
- Add support for logging. By default, Biome doesn't log anything other than diagnostics. Logging can be enabled with
  the new option `--log-level`:

  ```shell
  biome format --log-level=info ./src
  ```
  There are four different levels of logging, from the most verbose to the least verbose: `debug`, `info`, `warn`
  and `error`. Here's how an `INFO` log will look like:

  ```
  2023-10-05T08:27:01.954727Z  INFO  Analyze file ./website/src/playground/components/Resizable.tsx
    at crates/biome_service/src/file_handlers/javascript.rs:298 on biome::worker_5
    in Pulling diagnostics with categories: RuleCategories(SYNTAX)
    in Processes formatting with path: "./website/src/playground/components/Resizable.tsx"
    in Process check with path: "./website/src/playground/components/Resizable.tsx"
  ```

  You can customize how the log will look like with a new option `--log-kind`. The supported kinds
  are: `pretty`, `compact` and `json`.

  `pretty` is the default logging. Here's how a `compact` log will look like:

  ```
  2023-10-05T08:29:04.864247Z  INFO biome::worker_2 Process check:Processes linting:Pulling diagnostics: crates/biome_service/src/file_handlers/javascript.rs: Analyze file ./website/src/playground/components/Resizable.tsx path="./website/src/playground/components/Resizable.tsx" path="./website/src/playground/components/Resizable.tsx" categories=RuleCategories(LINT)

### Configuration

#### New features

- Add option `formatter.indentWidth`, and deprecated the option `formatter.indentSize`. Contributed by @ematipico
- Add option `javascript.formatter.indentWidth`, and deprecated the option `javascript.formatter.indentSize`.
  Contributed by @ematipico
- Add option `json.formatter.indentWidth`, and deprecated the option `json.formatter.indentSize`. Contributed by
  @ematipico
- Add option `include` to multiple sections of the configuration
  - `files.include`;
  - `formatter.include`;
  - `linter.include`;
  - `organizeImports.include`;
    When `include` and `ignore` are both specified, `ignore` takes **precedence** over `include`
- Add option `overrides`, where users can modify the behaviour of the tools for certain files or paths.

  For example, it's possible to modify the formatter `lineWidth`, and even `quoteStyle` for certain files that are
  included in glob path `generated/**`:

  ```json
  {
    "formatter": {
      "lineWidth": 100
    },
    "overrides": [
      {
        "include": ["generated/**"],
        "formatter": {
          "lineWidth": 160
        },
        "javascript": {
          "formatter": {
            "quoteStyle": "single"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Or, you can disable certain rules for certain path, and disable the linter for other paths:

  ```json
  {
    "linter": {
      "enabled": true,
      "rules": {
        "recommended": true
      }
    },
    "overrides": [
      {
        "include": ["lib/**"],
        "linter": {
          "rules": {
            "suspicious": {
              "noDebugger": "off"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "include": ["shims/**"],
        "linter": {
          "enabled": false
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  All code fixes are now emitted as unsafe code fixes.
  Removing a constructor can change the behavior of a program.

- [useCollapsedElseIf](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-collapsed-else-if/) now only provides safe code fixes.
  Contributed by @Conaclos

- [noUnusedVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-variables/) now reports more cases.

  The rule is now able to ignore self-writes.
  For example, the rule reports the following unused variable:

  ```js
  let a = 0;
  a++;
  a += 1;
  ```

  The rule is also capable of detecting an unused declaration that uses itself.
  For example, the rule reports the following unused interface:

  ```ts
  interface I {
    instance(): I
  }
  ```

  Finally, the rule now ignores all _TypeScript_ declaration files,
  including [global declaration files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/templates/global-d-ts.html).

### VSCode

#### Enhancements

- Improve server binary resolution when using certain package managers, notably pnpm.

  The new strategy is to point to `node_modules/.bin/biome` path,
  which is consistent for all package managers.

## 1.1.2 (2023-09-07)

### Editors

#### Bug fixes

- Fix a case where an empty JSON file would cause the LSP server to crash. Contributed by @ematipico

### Linter

#### Enhancements

- [useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) now accepts import namespaces in
  _PascalCase_ and rejects export namespaces in _CONSTANT\_CASE_.

  The following code is now valid:

  ```js
  import * as React from "react";
  ```

  And the following code is now invalid:

  ```js
  export * as MY_NAMESPACE from "./lib.js";
  ```

  Contributed by @Conaclos

- [noUselessConstructor](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-constructor/) now ignores decorated classes and
  decorated parameters. The rule now gives suggestions instead of safe fixes when parameters are annotated with types.
  Contributed by @Conaclos

## 1.1.1 (2023-09-07)

### Analyzer

#### Bug fixes

- The diagnostic for `// rome-ignore` suppression comment should not be a warning. A warning could block the CI, marking
  a gradual migration difficult. The code action that changes `// rome-ignore` to `// biome-ignore` is disabled as
  consequence. Contributed by @ematipico

## 1.1.0 (2023-09-06)

### Analyzer

#### Enhancements

- Add a code action to replace `rome-ignore` with `biome-ignore`. Use `biome check --apply-unsafe` to update all the
  comments. The action is not bulletproof, and it might generate unwanted code, that's why it's unsafe action.
  Contributed by @ematipico

### CLI

#### Enhancements

- Biome now reports a diagnostics when a `rome.json` file is found.
- `biome migrate --write` creates `biome.json` from `rome.json`, but it won't delete the `rome.json` file. Contributed
  by @ematipico

#### Bug fixes

- Biome uses `biome.json` first, then it attempts to use `rome.json`.
- Fix a case where Biome couldn't compute correctly the ignored files when the VSC integration is enabled. Contributed
  by @ematipico

### Configuration

### Editors

#### Bug fixes

- The LSP now uses its own socket and won't rely on Biome's socket. This fixes some cases where users were seeing
  multiple servers in the `rage` output.

### Formatter

#### Enhancements

- You can use `// biome-ignore` as suppression comment.
- The `// rome-ignore` suppression is deprecated.

### JavaScript APIs

### Linter

#### New features

- Add [useCollapsedElseIf](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-collapsed-else-if/) rule. This new rule requires merging
  an `else` and an `if`, if the `if` statement is the only statement in the `else` block. Contributed by @n-gude

#### Enhancements

- [useTemplate](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-template/) now reports all string concatenations.

  Previously, the rule ignored concatenation of a value and a newline or a backquote.
  For example, the following concatenation was not reported:

  ```js
  v + "\n";
  "`" + v + "`";
  ```

  The rule now reports these cases and suggests the following code fixes:

  ```diff
  - v + "\n";
  + `${v}\n`;
  - v + "`";
  + `\`${v}\``;
  ```

  Contributed by @Conaclos

- [useExponentiationOperator](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exponentiation-operator/) suggests better code fixes.

  The rule now preserves any comment preceding the exponent,
  and it preserves any parenthesis around the base or the exponent.
  It also adds spaces around the exponentiation operator `**`,
  and always adds parentheses for pre- and post-updates.

  ```diff
  - Math.pow(a++, /**/ (2))
  + (a++) ** /**/ (2)
  ```

  Contributed by @Conaclos

- You can use `// biome-ignore` as suppression comment.

- The `// rome-ignore` suppression is deprecated.

#### Bug fixes

- Fix [#80](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/95),
  making [noDuplicateJsxProps](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-duplicate-jsx-props/) case-insensitive.

  Some frameworks, such as Material UI, rely on the case-sensitivity of JSX properties.
  For
  example, [TextField has two properties with the same name, but distinct cases](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/text-field/#TextField-prop-inputProps):

  ```jsx
  <TextField inputLabelProps="" InputLabelProps=""></TextField>
  ```

- Fix [#138](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/138)

  [noCommaOperator](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-comma-operator/) now correctly ignores all use of comma
  operators inside the update part of a `for` loop.
  The following code is now correctly ignored:

  ```js
  for (
    let i = 0, j = 1, k = 2;
    i < 100;
    i++, j++, k++
  ) {}
  ```

- Fix [rome#4713](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4713).

  Previously, [useTemplate](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-template/) made the following suggestion:

  ```diff
  - a + b + "px"
  + `${a}${b}px`
  ```

  This breaks code where `a` and `b` are numbers.

  Now, the rule makes the following suggestion:

  ```diff
  - a + b + "px"
  + `${a + b}px`
   ```

  Contributed by @Conaclos

- Fix [rome#4109](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4109)

  Previously, [useTemplate](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-template/) suggested an invalid code fix when a leading
  or trailing single-line comment was present:

  ```diff
    // leading comment
  - 1 /* inner comment */ + "+" + 2 // trailing comment
  + `${// leading comment
  + 1 /* inner comment */}+${2 //trailing comment}` // trailing comment
  ```

  Now, the rule correctly handles this case:

  ```diff
    // leading comment
  - 1 + "+" + 2 // trailing comment
  + `${1}+${2}` // trailing comment
  ```

  As a sideeffect, the rule also suggests the removal of any inner comments.

- Fix [rome#3850](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/3850)

  Previously [useExponentiationOperator](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exponentiation-operator/) suggested
  invalid code in a specific edge case:

  ```diff
  - 1 +Math.pow(++a, 2)
  + 1 +++a**2
  ```

  Now, the rule properly adds parentheses:

  ```diff
  - 1 +Math.pow(++a, 2)
  + 1 +(++a) ** 2
  ```

## 1.0.0 (2023-08-28)

### Analyzer

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- The organize imports feature now groups import statements by "distance".

  Modules "farther" from the user are put on the top, and modules "closer" to the user are placed on the bottom.
  Check the [documentation](https://biomejs.dev/analyzer/) for more information about it.

- The organize imports tool is enabled by default. If you don't want to use it, you need to disable it explicitly:

  ```json
  {
    "organizeImports": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
  ```

### CLI

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- The CLI now exists with an error when there's an error inside the configuration.

  Previously, biome would raise warnings and continue the execution by applying its defaults.

  This could have been better for users because this could have created false positives in linting or formatted
  code with a configuration that wasn't the user's.

- The command `biome check` now shows formatter diagnostics when checking the code.

  The diagnostics presence will result in an error code when the command finishes.

  This aligns with semantic and behaviour meant for the command `biome check`.

- `init` command emits a `biome.json` file;

#### Other changes

- Fix [#4670](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4670), don't crash at empty default export.

- Fix [#4556](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4556), which correctly handles new lines in the
  `.gitignore` file across OS.

- Add a new option to ignore unknown files `--files-ignore-unknown`:

    ```shell
    biome format --files-ignore-unknown ./src
    ```

  Doing so, Biome won't emit diagnostics for files that doesn't know how to handle.

- Add the new option `--no-errors-on-unmatched`:

    ```shell
    biome format --no-errors-on-unmatched ./src
    ```

  Biome doesn't exit with an error code if no files were processed in the given paths.

- Fix the diagnostics emitted when running the `biome format` command.

- Biome no longer warns when discovering (possibly infinite) symbolic links between directories.

  This fixes [#4193](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4193) which resulted in incorrect warnings
  when a single file or directory was pointed at by multiple symbolic links. Symbolic links to other
  symbolic links do still trigger warnings if they are too deeply nested.

- Introduced a new command called `biome lint`, which will only run lint rules against the code base.

- Biome recognizes known files as "JSON files with comments allowed":

  - `typescript.json`;
  - `tsconfig.json`;
  - `jsconfig.json`;
  - `tslint.json`;
  - `babel.config.json`;
  - `.babelrc.json`;
  - `.ember-cli`;
  - `typedoc.json`;
  - `.eslintrc.json`;
  - `.eslintrc`;
  - `.jsfmtrc`;
  - `.jshintrc`;
  - `.swcrc`;
  - `.hintrc`;
  - `.babelrc`;
- Add support for `biome.json`;

### Configuration

#### Other changes

- Add a new option to ignore unknown files:

    ```json
    {
       "files": {
          "ignoreUnknown": true
       }
    }
    ```
  Doing so, Biome won't emit diagnostics for file that it doesn't know how to handle.

- Add a new `"javascript"` option to support the unsafe/experimental parameter decorators:

    ```json
    {
       "javascript": {
          "parser": {
             "unsafeParameterDecoratorsEnabled": true
          }
       }
    }
    ```

- Add a new `"extends"` option, useful to split the configuration file in multiple files:

  ```json
  {
    "extends": ["../sharedFormatter.json", "linter.json"]
  }
  ```

  The resolution of the files is file system based, Biome doesn't know how to
  resolve dependencies yet.

- The commands `biome check` and `biome lint` now show the remaining diagnostics even when
  `--apply-safe` or `--apply-unsafe` are passed.

- Fix the commands `biome check` and `biome lint`,
  they won't exit with an error code if no error diagnostics are emitted.

- Add a new option `--error-on-warnings`,
  which instructs Biome to exit with an error code when warnings are emitted.

  ```shell
  biome check --error-on-wanrings ./src
  ```

- Add a configuration to enable parsing comments inside JSON files:

  ```json
  {
    "json": {
      "parser": {
        "allowComments": true
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Editors

#### Other changes

- The Biome LSP can now show diagnostics belonging to JSON lint rules.

- The Biome LSP no longer applies unsafe quickfixes on-save when `editor.codeActionsOnSave.quickfix.biome` is enabled.

- Fix [#4564](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4564); files too large don't emit errors.

- The Biome LSP sends client messages when files are ignored or too big.

### Formatter

- Add a new option called `--jsx-quote-style`.

  This option lets you choose between single and double quotes for JSX attributes.

- Add the option `--arrow-parentheses`.

  This option allows setting the parentheses style for arrow functions.

- The _JSON_ formatter can now format `.json` files with comments.

### Linter

#### Removed rules

- Remove `complexity/noExtraSemicolon` ([#4553](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4553))

  The _Biome_ formatter takes care of removing extra semicolons.
  Thus, there is no need for this rule.

- Remove `useCamelCase`

  Use [useNamingConvention](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-naming-convention/) instead.

#### New rules

- Add [noExcessiveComplexity](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-excessive-cognitive-complexity/)

- Add [useImportRestrictions](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-import-restrictions/)

- Add [noFallthroughSwitchClause](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-fallthrough-switch-clause/)

- Add [noGlobalIsFinite](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-global-is-finite/)

  This rule recommends using `Number.isFinite` instead of the global and unsafe `isFinite` that attempts a type
  coercion.

- Add [noGlobalIsNan](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-global-is-nan/)

  This rule recommends using `Number.isNaN` instead of the global and unsafe `isNaN` that attempts a type coercion.

- Add [noUnsafeDeclarationMerging](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unsafe-declaration-merging/)

  This rule disallows declaration merging between an interface and a class.

- Add [noUselessThisAlias](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-this-alias/)

  This rule disallows useless aliasing of `this` in arrow functions.

- Add [useArrowFunction](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-arrow-function/)

  This rule proposes turning function expressions into arrow functions.
  Function expressions that use `this` are ignored.

- Add [noDuplicateJsonKeys](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-duplicate-json-keys/)

  This rule disallow duplicate keys in a JSON object.

- Add [noVoid](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-void/)

  This rule disallows the use of `void`.

- Add [noNonoctalDecimalEscape](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-nonoctal-decimal-escape/)

  This rule disallows `\8` and `\9` escape sequences in string literals.

- Add [noUselessEmptyExport](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-empty-export/)

  This rule disallows useless `export {}`.

- Add [useIsArray](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-is-array/)

  This rule proposes using `Array.isArray()` instead of `instanceof Array`.

- Add [useGetterReturn](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-getter-return/)

  This rule enforces the presence of non-empty return statements in getters.
  This makes the following code incorrect:

  ```js
  class Person {
      get firstName() {}
  }
  ```

#### Promoted rules

New rules are promoted, please check [#4750](https://github.com/rome/tools/discussions/4750) for more details:

- [a11y/useHeadingContent](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-heading-content/)
- [complexity/noForEach](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-for-each/)
- [complexity/useLiteralKeys](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-literal-keys/)
- [complexity/useSimpleNumberKeys](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-simple-number-keys/)
- [correctness/useIsNan](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-is-nan/)
- [suspicious/noConsoleLog](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-console-log/)
- [suspicious/noDuplicateJsxProps](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-duplicate-jsx-props/)

The following rules are now recommended:

**- [noUselessFragments](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-fragments/)

- [noRedundantUseStrict](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redundant-use-strict/)
- [useExponentiationOperator](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exponentiation-operator/)**

#### Other changes

- Add new TypeScript globals (`AsyncDisposable`, `Awaited`, `DecoratorContext`, and
  others) [4643](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4643).

- [noRedeclare](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redeclare/): allow redeclare of index signatures are in different
  type members [#4478](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4478)

-
Improve [noConsoleLog](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-console-log/), [noGlobalObjectCalls](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-global-object-calls/), [useIsNan](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-is-nan/),
and [useNumericLiterals](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-numeric-literals/) by handling `globalThis` and `window`
namespaces.

For instance, the following code is now reported by `noConsoleLog`:

```js
globalThis.console.log("log")
```

- Improve [noDuplicateParameters](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-duplicate-parameters/) to manage constructor
  parameters.

- Improve [noInnerDeclarations](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-inner-declarations/)

  Now, the rule doesn't report false-positives about ambient _TypeScript_ declarations.
  For example, the following code is no longer reported by the rule:

  ```ts
  declare var foo;
  ```

- Improve [useEnumInitializers](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-enum-initializers/)

  The rule now reports all uninitialized members of an enum in a single diagnostic.

  Moreover, ambient enum declarations are now ignored.
  This avoids reporting ambient enum declarations in _TypeScript_ declaration files.

  ```ts
  declare enum Weather {
    Rainy,
    Sunny,
  }
  ```

- Relax [noBannedTypes](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-banned-types/) and improve documentation

  The rule no longer reports a user type that reuses a banned type name.
  The following code is now allowed:

  ```ts
  import { Number } from "a-lib";
  declare const v: Number;
  ```

  The rule now allows the use of the type `{}` to denote a non-nullable generic type:

  ```ts
  function f<T extends {}>(x: T) {
      assert(x != null);
  }
  ```

  And in a type intersection for narrowing a type to its non-nullable equivalent type:

  ```ts
  type NonNullableMyType = MyType & {};
  ```

- Improve [noConstantCondition](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-constant-condition/)

  The rule now allows `while(true)`.
  This recognizes a common pattern in the web community:

  ```js
  while (true) {
    if (cond) {
      break;
    }
  }
  ```

- Improve the diagnostic and the code action
  of [useDefaultParameterLast](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-default-parameter-last/).

  The diagnostic now reports the last required parameter which should precede optional and default parameters.

  The code action now removes any whitespace between the parameter name and its initialization.

- Relax `noConfusingArrow`

  All arrow functions that enclose its parameter with parenthesis are allowed.
  Thus, the following snippet no longer trigger the rule:

  ```js
  var x = (a) => 1 ? 2 : 3;
  ```

  The following snippet still triggers the rule:

  ```js
  var x = a => 1 ? 2 : 3;
  ```

- Relax [useLiteralEnumMembers](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-literal-enum-members/)

  Enum members that refer to previous enum members are now allowed.
  This allows a common pattern in enum flags like in the following example:

  ```ts
  enum FileAccess {
    None = 0,
    Read = 1,
    Write = 1 << 1,
    All = Read | Write,
  }
  ```

  Arbitrary numeric constant expressions are also allowed:

  ```ts
  enum FileAccess {
    None = 0,
    Read = 2**0,
    Write = 2**1,
    All = Read | Write,
  }
  ```

- Improve [useLiteralKeys](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-literal-keys/).

  Now, the rule suggests simplifying computed properties to string literal properties:

  ```diff
  {
  -  ["1+1"]: 2,
  +  "1+1": 2,
  }
  ```

  It also suggests simplifying string literal properties to static properties:

  ```diff
  {
  -  "a": 0,
  +  a: 0,
  }
  ```

  These suggestions are made in object literals, classes, interfaces, and object types.

- Improve [noNewSymbol](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-new-symbol/).

  The rule now handles cases where `Symbol` is namespaced with the global `globalThis` or `window`.

- The rules [useExhaustiveDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies/)
  and [useHookAtTopLevel](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-hook-at-top-level/) accept a different shape of options

  Old configuration:

  ```json
  {
    "linter": {
       "rules": {
          "nursery": {
             "useExhaustiveDependencies": {
                "level": "error",
                "options": {
                   "hooks": [
                      ["useMyEffect", 0, 1]
                   ]
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
  }
  ```

  New configuration:

  ```json
  {
    "linter": {
       "rules": {
          "nursery": {
             "useExhaustiveDependencies": {
                "level": "error",
                "options": {
                   "hooks": [
                      {
                         "name": "useMyEffect",
                         "closureIndex": 0,
                         "dependenciesIndex": 1
                      }
                   ]
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
  }
  ```

- [noRedundantUseStrict](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-redundant-use-strict/) check only `'use strict'` directive
  to resolve false positive diagnostics.

  React introduced new directives, "use client" and "use server".
  The rule raises false positive errors about these directives.

- Fix a crash in the [NoParameterAssign](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-parameter-assign/) rule that occurred when
  there was a bogus binding. [#4323](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4323)

- Fix [useExhaustiveDependencies](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies/) in the following
  cases [#4330](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4330):

  - when the first argument of hooks is a named function
  - inside an export default function
  - for `React.use` hooks

- Fix [noInvalidConstructorSuper](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-invalid-constructor-super/) that erroneously
  reported generic parents [#4624](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4624).

- Fix [noDuplicateCase](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-duplicate-case/) that erroneously reported as equals the
  strings literals `"'"` and `'"'` [#4706](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4706).

- Fix [NoUnreachableSuper](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unreachable-super/)'s false positive
  diagnostics ([#4483](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4483)) caused to nested if statement.

  The rule no longer reports `This constructor calls super() in a loop`
  when using nested if statements in a constructor.

- Fix [useHookAtTopLevel](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-hook-at-top-level/)'s false positive
  diagnostics ([#4637](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4637))

  The rule no longer reports false positive diagnostics when accessing properties directly from a hook and calling a
  hook inside function arguments.

- Fix [noUselessConstructor](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-constructor/) which erroneously reported
  constructors with default parameters [rome#4781](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4781)

- Fix [noUselessFragments](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-useless-fragments/)'s panics when
  running `biome check --apply-unsafe` ([#4637](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4639))

  This rule's code action emits an invalid AST, so I fixed using JsxString instead of JsStringLiteral

- Fix [noUndeclaredVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-undeclared-variables/)'s false positive
  diagnostics ([#4675](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4675))

  The semantic analyzer no longer handles `this` reference identifier.

- Fix [noUnusedVariables](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-unused-variables/)'s false positive
  diagnostics ([#4688](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/4688))

  The semantic analyzer handles ts export declaration clause correctly.

### Parser

- Add support for decorators in class method parameters, example:

    ```js
    class AppController {
       get(@Param() id) {}
       // ^^^^^^^^ new supported syntax
    }
    ```

  This syntax is only supported via configuration, because it's a non-standard syntax.

    ```json
    {
       "javascript": {
          "parser": {
             "unsafeParameterDecoratorsEnabled": true
          }
       }
    }
    ```
- Add support for parsing comments inside JSON files:

  ```json
  {
    "json": {
      "parser": {
        "allowComments": true
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Add support for the new `using` syntax

  ```js
  const using = resource.lock();
  ```
