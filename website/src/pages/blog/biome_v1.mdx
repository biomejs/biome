In Biome v1, the formatter has options for JSX quotes and parentheses in the arrow functions; the CLI adds a new command `biome lint`, `.jsonc` files are supported, and it's possible to extend the configuration file.

<description-end />

You can upgrade Biome by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact biome@1.0.0
pnpm update --save-exact biome@1.0.0
yarn upgrade --exact biome@1.0.0
```

Or install the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) to integrate Biome into your editor.

## New formatter options

Biome now supports two new, long-awaited options:
- support for formatting the preferred quote kind in JSX;
- support for formatting parenthesis in arrow functions only when they are needed;


### JSX quotes style

You can use this option via CLI or via `rome.json` file:

```json
{
  "javascript": {
   "formatter": {
    "jsxQuoteStyle": "single"
   }
  }
}
```

```shell
biome format --jsx-quote-style=single --write ./src
```

And Biome will apply single quotes when defining attributes in JSX code:

```jsx
import Item from "./item.jsx";

const Header = () => {
    return <Item title='Docs' />;
}
```

### Arrow function parenthesis

You can decide not to print parenthesis in arrow functions. You can customize the option via CLI or via `rome.json`:

```json
{
  "javascript": {
   "formatter": {
    "arrowParentheses": "asNeeded"
   }
  }
}
```

```shell
biome format --arrow-parentheses=as-needed --write ./src
```

And Biome will print parenthesis only for those arrow functions that require them:

```jsx
// no need for parentheses
const filter = term => {};
// needs parentheses
const filterBy = (term, fn) => {}
```

## CLI improvements

The CLI was heavily reworked to guarantee consistent behaviour when handling files, diagnostics emitted and commands.

Among those changes, there are some **breaking changes** in its behaviour.

- The CLI exits with an error code if the configuration file contains errors; while Biome can parse the configuration successfully - even with errors - this was a hazard for our users.
A typo in the configuration file would have resulted in Biome applying its defaults, and executing Biome with a different behaviour compared to the one set by the user.
- The command `biome check` will now emit error diagnostics for *code not formatted* and exits with an error code. This behaviour aligns with the semantics meant for this command.

### New `biome lint` command

The command `biome check` is meant to run multiple tools, which sometimes can overwhelm the users. With `biome lint`, Biome will only run lint rules against files.

As for now, the command accepts almost all the CLI arguments of the `biome check`. In the future, this command will specialize and tweak its behaviour around linting.

### More control over errors

By default, when Biome sees a file that can't handle, it fires a diagnostic and will exit with an error code.

With `--files-ignore-unknown` option, the CLI won't emit diagnostics and will continue processing files.

You can define this behaviour in the `rome.json` too:

```json
{
  "files": {
   "ignoreUnknown": true
  }
}
```

When Biome doesn't process files during a command, it exits with an error code and emits an error diagnostic.

Now, with `--no-errors-on-unmatched`, Biome will exist with a successful code and doesn't emit any diagnostics.

This new option allows users to use Biome with tools like `lint-staged`.

### Exit on warnings

In Biome, you can change the configuration of rules and allow them to emit diagnostics. This behaviour was limited, and now with `--error-on-warnings` option, you can tell Biome to exit with an error code if a **warning** is emitted.

Here's an example, let's change the diagnostic level of a rule via `rome.json`:

```json
{
  "linter": {
   "recommended": true,
   "rules": {
    "a11y": {
     "useAtlText": "warn"
    }
   }
  }
}
```

Here's a sample code that will trigger the rule:

```jsx
const Image = () => {
    return <img src="https://example.com/image.png"  />
}
```

And now, run the CLI using the new option:

```shell
biome lint --error-on-warnings ./src
```

## JSONC support and comments

Biome's JSON parser now supports comments, so we enabled these exciting new features.

### `.jsonc` file support

Biome can now format and lint `.jsonc` files.

### Allow comments in JSON files

Biome can parse comments inside JSON files. You can opt-in to this feature via the configuration file:

```json
{
  "json": {
   "parser": {
    "allowComments": true
   }
  }
}
```

> **NOTE**: the `rome.json` file **doesn't** allow comments.

> **WARNING**: when enabling this feature, comments will be permitted in **all** JSON files encountered by Biome.

Plus, Biome now recognizes some **known** files as "JSON files that can have comments". For example, now Biome can
format your `tsconfig.json` file with comments without emitting errors!

## `extends` property

You can now break down your configuration file into different files and join them using the new `extends` property.

```json
{
  "extends": ["./formatter.json", "./linter.json"]
}
```

Check the [documentation](/configuration#extends) to understand how it works.

## Linter

We **deleted** two rules:
- `useCamelCase`, which is replaced by `useNamingConvention`;
- `noExtraSemicolon`, not needed; the formatter takes care of it;

### New Rules

- [`noExcessiveComplexity`](/lint/rules/noExcessiveComplexity/)

	The reduce the complexity of your code by tracking the complexity score.

- [`useImportRestrictions`](/lint/rules/useImportRestrictions/)

	Enables restrictions on how local imports should be imported.

- [`useNamingConvention`](/lint/rules/useNamingConvention/)

	The rule enforces wide-spread naming conventions of Javascript and TypeScript across a codebase.

- [`noFallthroughSwitchClause`](/lint/rules/noFallthroughSwitchClause/)

	The rule disallows switch cases that fall through to the next `case`.

- [`noGlobalIsFinite`](/lint/rules/noglobalisfinite/)

	This rule recommends using `Number.isFinite` instead of the global and unsafe `isFinite` that attempts a type of coercion.

- [`noGlobalIsNan`](/lint/rules/noglobalisnan/)

	This rule recommends using `Number.isNaN` instead of the global and unsafe `isNaN` that attempts a type of coercion.

- [`noUnsafeDeclarationMerging`](/lint/rules/noUnsafeDeclarationMerging/)

	This rule disallows declaration merging between an interface and a class.

- [`useArrowFunction`](/lint/rules/usearrowfunction/)

	This rule proposes turning function expressions into arrow functions.
	Function expressions that use `this` are ignored.

- [`noDuplicateJsonKeys`](/lint/rules/noDuplicateJsonKeys/)

	This rule disallows duplicate keys in a JSON object.

- [`noVoid`](/lint/rules/novoid/)

	This rule disallows the use of `void`.

- [`noNonoctalDecimalEscape`](/lint/rules/nononoctaldecimalescape/)

	This rule disallows `\8` and `\9` escape sequences in string literals.

- [`noUselessEmptyExport`](/lint/rules/noUselessEmptyExport/)

	This rule disallows useless `export {}`.

- [`useIsArray`](/lint/rules/useIsArray/)

	This rule proposes using `Array.isArray()` instead of `instanceof Array`.

- [`useGetterReturn`](/lint/rules/useGetterReturn/)

  This rule enforces `get` methods to always return a value.

#### Promoted rules

New rules are promoted, please check [#4750](https://github.com/rome/tools/discussions/4750) for more details:

- [`a11y/useHeadingContent`](/lint/rules/useHeadingContent/)
- [`complexity/noForEach`](/lint/rules/noForEach/)
- [`complexity/useLiteralKeys`](/lint/rules/useLiteralKeys/)
- [`complexity/useSimpleNumberKeys`](/lint/rules/useSimpleNumberKeys/)
- [`correctness/useIsNan`](/lint/rules/useIsNan/)
- [`suspicious/noConsoleLog`](/lint/rules/noConsoleLog/)
- [`suspicious/noDuplicateJsxProps`](/lint/rules/noDuplicateJsxProps/)

The following rules are now recommended:

- [`noUselessFragments`](/lint/rules/noUselessFragments/)
- [`noRedundantUseStrict`](/lint/rules/noRedundantUseStrict/)
- [`useExponentiationOperator`](/lint/rules/useExponentiationOperator/)

## Support for function class parameter decorators

In the last release, Biome introduced support for Stage 3 decorators. Although, this final proposal doesn't support the function class parameter decorators:

```js
class Controller {
    get(@Param("id") id: string) {}
    // ^^^^^^^^^^^^ syntax not covered by the official and final decorators spec
}
```

Some users were dissatisfied because they couldn't use Biome inside their Angular/NestJS project. Now you can do it via configuration:

```json
{
  "javascript": {
   "parser": {
    "unsafeParameterDecoratorsEnabled": true
   }
  }
}
```
