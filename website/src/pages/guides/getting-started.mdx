# Getting Started

## System Requirements

* Windows (including WSL), macOS, or Linux
* x86_64 or ARM64
* Node.js v14.18 or newer (not applicable if you use the standalone executable)

## Installation

The fastest way to download Biome is to use `npm` or your preferred package manager. The CLI is also available as a [standalone executable](/standalone-executable) if you want to use Biome without installing Node.js.

To install Biome, run the following commands in a directory containing a `package.json` file.

<PackageManagerCommand
  npm="install --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome"
  pnpm="add --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome"
  yarn="add --dev --exact @biomejs/biome"
/>

> **Note**: It is also possible to install Biome globally rather than locally.
However, this is not recommended.

It's **highly recommended** not to use range operators when installing Biome.
Check the [versioning page](/internals/versioning/) for more information.

You can now run Biome with:

<PackageManagerRomeCommand command="" />

## Configuration

We recommend creating a `biome.json` configuration file for each project.
It eliminates  the need to repeat the CLI options every time you run a command and ensures that Biome applies the same configuration in your editor. If you're happy with Biome's defaults, you don't have to create the configuration.

To create the configuration, run the `init` command in the root folder of your project:

<PackageManagerRomeCommand command="init" />

After running the `init` command, you'll now have a new `biome.json` file in your directory:

<CodeBlockHeader filename="biome.json" />

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@biomejs/biome/configuration_schema.json",
  "organizeImports": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  }
}
```

The `linter.enabled: true` enables the linter and `rules.recommended: true` enables the [recommended rules](/lint/rules/).

Formatting is enabled because the configuration doesn't explicitly [disable](/configuration/#formatterenabled) formatting with `formatter.enabled: false`.

## Usage

You can lint any file or directory running:

<PackageManagerRomeCommand command="check <files>" />

or format your files and directories with:

<PackageManagerRomeCommand command="format <files> --write" />

{/**Make sure to update the redirect in `static/_redirects` when changing the editors title -->**/}

## Editor Setup

We recommend installing our editor integration to get the most out of Biome.
The Biome editor integration allows you to:

* Format files on save or when issuing the Format command.
* Lint files and apply code fixes

### VS Code

Install our official [Biome VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

To make Biome the default formatter open a supported file (JavaScript or TypeScript) and:

* open the *Command Palette* (View or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd title="Cmd">⌘</kbd>+<kbd title="Shift">⇧</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>)
* select  *Format Document With...*
* select *Configure Default Formatter*
* select *Biome*.

### Other Editors

We would love to support more editors, but we don't have the capacity to implement and maintain multiple editor integrations at the moment.
Because Biome uses the language server protocol (LSP), it should be relatively easy to get Biome working with any editor with an LSP client.
If you're interested in building an integration for Biome, please, reach out, and we would be more than happy to support you.


## CI Setup

If you're using Node.js, the recommended way to run Biome in CI is to use [your favourite package manager](/guides/getting-started#installation).
This ensures that your CI pipeline uses the same version of Biome as you do inside the editor or when running local CLI commands.
