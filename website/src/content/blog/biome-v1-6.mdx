title: Biome v1.6
description: Partial support for Astro, Svelte and Vue, extend configuration from dependencies, formatter goodies.
summary: |
  Partial support for Astro, Svelte and Vue files, both CLI and LSP.
  Now, the `extends` field is able to pick configuration files that are exported as a dependency, very useful in monorepo and big projects.
  The formatter has new options.

## Partial support for Astro, Svelte and Vue files

In this release, we're happy to provide partial support for Astor, Svelte and Vue files. What does **partial** support mean?

While the team is working on a [unified data structure](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/discussions/1726) for HTML-ish languages, we discovered that we could provide Biome functionalities to those files with just few changes, albeit some expectations.

This means that Biome is able to analyse the JavaScript/TypeScript portion of said files, and all features are available: formatting, linting and import sorting! Here's an example that you should expect in terms of developer experience:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Astro" icon="astro">
        <div align="center">
            <Image src={astroLint} alt="Screenshot of Biome linting in action for an Astro file in VSCode" width="500"  />
        </div>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Vue" icon="seti:vue">
        <div align="center">
            <Image src={vueLint} alt="Screenshot of Biome linting in action for an Vue file in VSCode" width="500"  />
        </div>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Svelte" icon="seti:svelte">
        <div align="center">
            <Image src={svelteLint} alt="Screenshot of Biome  linting in action for an Svelte file in VSCode" width="500"  />
        </div>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Make sure to read the [documentation about expectations and limitations](/internals/language-support#html-super-languages-support).

## Configuration, lighter and more powerful

### Support for `biome.jsonc`

Biome now accepts the file `biome.jsonc` as configuration! Now, you can insert all the comments you want in a configuration.

### `extends` resolves dependencies

From this version, Biome can the `extends` property can *resolve* other configuration files that are installed and exported as a dependency.

There are few important steps in order to make the configuration discoverable. The file must be exported from a `"module"` package, and the file should be exported in your `package.json` like this:

```json name="shared-configs/package.json"
{
  "name": "@shared-configs",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    "./biome": "./biome.json"
  }
}
```

This set up allows to expose a specifier `@shared-configs/biome`, which you use inside your `biome.json` file.

```json name="project/biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["@shared-configs/biome"]
}
```

The resolution of the dependencies is powered by the library [`oxc-resolver`](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc-resolver), one of the many libraries provided by the [OXC project](https://oxc-project.github.io/). It's battle-tested and spec compliant!

:::note
You can also export `biome.jsonc` files!

```json name="shared-configs/package.json" ins="./biome.jsonc"
{
  "name": "@shared-configs",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    "./biome": "./biome.jsonc"
  }
}
```
:::

### Reduced memory footprint

We **reduced** the size our configuration **by a factor of 6.5**! This change might not have massive effects on the speed of the program, but it greatly reduced the memory used when running the CLI or the LSP.

## New formatting options

Other than fixes, the formatter provides two new options that should improve the compatibility with Prettier parity

### Option `attributePosition`

The contributor [@octoshikari](https://github.com/octoshikari) implemented this new feature by themselves! Huge thank you for helping the Biome project.

When `formatter.attributePosition` has the value `multiline`, all attributes of HTML-ish languages (JSX/TSX as for time of writing) will be collapsed on multiple lines regardless of their numbers:


<div class="card">
    <div class="card-column">
        <h4>With variant `auto` (default)</h4>
        The attributes are automatically formatted, and they will collapse in multiple lines only when they hit certain criteria.

        ```jsx title="file.jsx"
        <Button as="link" style="primary" href="https://example.com">
            Hit me
        </Button>
        ```
    </div>
    <div class="card-column">
        <h4>With variant `multiline`</h4>
        The attributes are always formatted on multiple lines, regardless.

        ```jsx title="file.jsx"
        <Button
            as="link"
            style="primary"
            href="https://example.com"
        >
            Hit me
        </Button>
        ```
    </div>
</div>


### Option `json.formatter.trailingComma`

Previously, Biome parser introduced an option that would allow to parse JSON and JSONC files that contained a trailing comma. This was required to ease the friction caused by other tools that
tolerate trailing commas by default (e.g. VSCode, Prettier, etc.).

Although, our formatter wasn't as tolerant. With the option `json.formatter.trailingComma`, you can apply the same rules that `js.formatter.trailingComma` applies.

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-column">
        <h4>With variant `none` (default)</h4>
        The formatter removes the trailing comma upon formatting.

        ```json title="file.json" ins="\"ipsum_last\""
        {
            "lorem": "ipsum",
            "lorem": "ipsum",
            "lorem": "ipsum",
            "lorem": "ipsum_last"
        }
        ```
    </div>
    <div class="card-column">
        <h4>With variant `all`</h4>
        The formatter adds the trailing comma upon formatting.

        ```json title="file.json" ins="\"ipsum_last\","
        {
            "lorem": "ipsum",
            "lorem": "ipsum",
            "lorem": "ipsum",
            "lorem": "ipsum_last",
        }
        ```
    </div>
</div>

## Easier migration from Prettier

This release introduces a new command called `biome migrate prettier`. This command will read your Prettier `.prettierrc`/`prettier.json` and `.prettierignore`, and attempt to port its options and globs in Biome.

Given a `prettier.json` file, Biome will **modify** the existing configuration file to match Prettier's options:

```json title="prettier.json"
{ "useTabs": false, "semi": true, "singleQuote": true }
```

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "formatWithErrors": false,
    "indentStyle": "space",
    "indentWidth": 2,
    "lineEnding": "lf",
    "lineWidth": 80,
    "attributePosition": "auto"
  },
  "linter": { "enabled": true },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "jsxQuoteStyle": "double",
      "quoteProperties": "asNeeded",
      "trailingComma": "all",
      "semicolons": "always",
      "arrowParentheses": "always",
      "bracketSpacing": true,
      "bracketSameLine": false,
      "quoteStyle": "single",
      "attributePosition": "auto"
    }
  }
}
```

:::caution
Due to the different nature of `.prettierignore` globs and Biome’s globs, it’s **highly advised** to make sure that those globs still work under Biome.
Prettier's globs are **git globs**, while Biome's globs are **unix-style** globs.
