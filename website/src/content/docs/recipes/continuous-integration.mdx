Running Biome in a CI environment is easy. Check out the following examples for some inspiration.

## GitHub Actions

We provides a first-party [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-biome) to setup Biome in your runner.
Here's what a simple workflow might look like:

```yaml
name: Code quality

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout 
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Biome
        uses: biomejs/setup-biome@v1
        with:
          version: 1.2.2
      - name: Run Biome
        run: biome ci .
```
