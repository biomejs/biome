With the release of Biome **`v1.4.0`**, we claim the bounty of the [Prettier challenge](https://console.algora.io/challenges/prettier)!

With `v1.4.0`, you'll get a better formatter experience, more formatting options, new VSCode features, new sponsors and more!

You can upgrade Biome by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome@1.4.0
pnpm update --save-exact @biomejs/biome@1.4.0
yarn upgrade --exact @biomejs/biome@1.4.0
```

##  Better formatter

Biome formatter has now **over 96% in terms of compatibility** against [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)!

Merit of challenge that was launched by [Christopher Chedeau](https://twitter.com/Vjeux/status/1722733472522142022), one of the Prettier's creators.

The challenge attracted the attention of many people, and some of them decided to contribute to Biome to claim part of the bounty. I did see something amazing: contributors had an amazing coordination, they took ownership of the tasks and delivered the solution in a matter of hours.

I believe the main factors that made this possible are three:
1. Money. It's a fact, and it's completely fine if someone decides to contribute only for earning a small stipend out of it.
2. Communication. We used [GitHub](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/720) as only medium of coordination. We provided information, instructions and help on how to deliver.
3. Infrastructure. Biome relies on a solid testing infrastructure, built by [previous](https://github.com/MichaReiser) Rome Tools [employees](https://github.com/ematipico) and [contributors](https://github.com/IWANABETHATGUY/). It's able to catch every idempotency bug, provide granular diffs and warn the user if the emitted output is the different from the one emitted by Prettier.

Before the challenge, Biome had roughly a compatibility rate of 85%, based on our internal metrics (JavaScript, TypeScript and JSX, on options parity). Even though 85% might seem high,
the impact of a low number such as 15% on big code bases is huge, and people might feel intimidated by so many changes, causing early adopters to receive frictions when bring Biome to their team. A member of our community shared some insights:

> As a great example of how much even just that last 5% has improved things for large codebases (and specifically with `bracketSpacing` and now `bracketSameLine` implemented) i ran it one project in our monorepo [...].
>
> Just last week, this number `[diagnostics]` was more than 6,000. Even with the bracket options ignored, it was still more than 1000, and now there are only 200 left!

The challenge has also uncovered some cases in Prettier's emitted output that we decided to not follow. We have created a [new section](/formatter/#differences-with-prettier) in our website that explains them. Our hope is to make this section smaller with the time.

#### New formatting options

With this challenge, we added new options to the formatter:
- [`lineEnding`](/reference/configuration#formatterlineending)

  Use this option to match the line endings of your OS. We support `lf` (line feed - `\n`), `cr` (carriage return - `\r`) and `crlf` (carriage return line feed - `\r\n`).

- [`bracketSameLine`](/reference/configuration#formatterbracketsameline)

  ```jsx title="example.js"
  // Existing behavior. Now also the default, meaning `bracketSameLine: true`.
  <Foo
    className={somethingReallyLongThatForcesThisToWrap}
    anotherReallyLongAttribute={withAValueThatsSurelyTooLong}
    soThatEverythingWraps
  >
    Hello
  </Foo>

  <Foo
    selfClosingTags={likeThisOne}
    stillPlaceTheBracket={onItsOwnLine}
    toIndicateThat={itClosesItself}
  />
  ```

  After formatting with `"bracketSameLine": true`:

  ```jsx title="example.js"
  // New behavior, with `bracketSameLine: false`.
  <Foo
    className={somethingReallyLongThatForcesThisToWrap}
    anotherReallyLongAttribute={withAValueThatsSurelyTooLong}
    soThatEverythingWraps>
    Hello
  </Foo>

  <Foo
    selfClosingTags={likeThisOne}
    stillPlaceTheBracket={onItsOwnLine}
  />
  ```

- [`bracketSpacing`](/reference/configuration#formatterbracketspacing)

  ```js title="example.js"
  import { sort } from "sort.js";
  const value = { sort }
  ```

  After formatting with `"bracketSpacing": false`:

  ```js title="example.js"
  import {sort} from "sort.js";
  const value = {sort}
  ```

## VSCode extension goodies

## Some CLI goodies

People that rely on Biome LSP will be pleased that they can now pass a custom configuration to the command `lsp-proxy`, using the option `--config-path`. The same option is accepted by the command `start`:

```shell
biome --config-path=../path/where/config/is lsp-proxy
biome --config-path=../path/where/config/is start
````

The CLI now exposes the option `--diagnostic-level`, that allows to filter the kind of diagnostics printed to terminal.

```shell
biome check --diagnostic-level=error ./src
```

## New lint rules, and promoted rule


## Homage to our maintainers

Since Biome was forked, new people joined the project. They have been helping with in so many ways that you can't even imagine: new features, side projects, engaging with the community, support, documentation, and more. OSS is not just about coding.
