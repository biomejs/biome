Biome can provide some tools that can help you to use it properly in big projects, such as monorepo or workspaces that contain multiple projects.


## Use multiple configuration files

When you use Biome's features - either with the CLI or LSP - the tool looks for the nearest configuration file using the current working directory.

If Biome doesn't find the configuration file there, it **starts walking upwards** the directories of the file system, until it finds one.

You can leverage this feature to apply different settings based on the project/folder.

Let's suppose we have a project that contains a backend app and new frontend app.


<FileTree>
  - app
    - backend
      - biome.json
      - package.json
    - frontend
      - biome.json
      - legacy-app
        - package.json
      - new-app
        - package.json
</FileTree>

This means that when you run a script from the file `app/backend/package.json`, Biome will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`.

When you run a script from `app/frontend/legacy-app/package.json` or `app/frontend/new-app/package.json`, Biome will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`.

## Share the configuration

It's possible to use the [`extends`](/reference/configuration#extends) configuration option to breakdown options across files.

Let's assume that we have these requirements:
- `legacy-app` have to format using spaces;
- `backend` and `new-app` have to format using tabs;
- all apps have to format using line width 120;
- `backend` app needs some extra linting;

We start by creating a new configuration file at `app/biome.json`, and put there the shared options:


```json title="app/biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "lineWidth": 120
  }
}
```

Now let's **move** `app/frontend/biome.json` to `app/frontend/legacy-app/`, because that's where we need to use a different formatting.


```json title="app/frontend/legacy-app/biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space"
  }
}
```

Then, we tell Biome to inherit all the options from the main `app/biome.json` file, using the `extends` property:

```json title="app/frontend/legacy-app/biome.json" ins={2}
{
   "extends": ["../../biome.json"],
   "formatter": {
     "indentStyle": "space"
   }
}
```

Let's jump to `app/backend/biome.json`, where we need to enable the linting:


```json title="app/backend/biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["../biome.json"],
  "linter": {
    "enabled": "true",
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Monorepos

Monorepos are particular repositories where multiple libraries are stored and maintained in one big repository. Each library represents a self-contained project, which can contain different configurations.

Biome doesn't support monorepos very well due to some limitations in resolving nested configuration files, you [help and follow the relative issue](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2228).

In order to have the best developer experience despite the current limitation, it's advised to have a `biome.json` at the root of the monorepo, and use the [`overrides`](/reference/configuration/#overrides) configuration to change the behaviour of Biome in certain packages.

In the following example we disable the rule `suspicious/noConsoleLog` inside the package `packages/logger`.

```json title="biome.jsonc"

{
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  },
  "overrides": [{
      "include": ["packages/logger/**"],
      "linter": {
        "rules": {
          "rules": {
            "suspicious": {
              "noConsoleLog": "off"
            }
          }
        }
      }
  }]
}
```
