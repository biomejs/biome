Biome can provide some tools that can help you to use it properly in big projects, such as monorepo or workspaces that contain multiple projects.


## Use multiple configuration files

When you use Biome's features - either with the CLI or LSP - the tool looks for the nearest configuration file using the current working directory.

If Biome doesn't find the configuration file there, it **starts walking upwards** the directories of the file system, until it finds one.

You can leverage this feature to apply different settings based on the project/folder.

Let's suppose we have a project that contains a backend app and new frontend app.


```
app
├── backend
│   ├── biome.json
│   └── package.json
└── frontend
    ├── biome.json
    ├── legacy-app
    │   └── package.json
    └── new-app
        └── package.json
```

This means that when you run a script from the file `app/backend/package.json`, Biome will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`.

When you run a script from `app/frontend/legacy-app/package.json` or `app/frontend/new-app/package.json`, Biome will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`.

## Share the configuration

It's possible to use the [`extends`](/reference/configuration#extends) configuration option to breakdown options across files.

Let's assume that we have these requirements:
- `legacy-app` have to format using spaces;
- `backend` and `new-pp` have to format using tabs;
- all apps have to format using line width 120;
- `backend` app needs some extra linting;

We start by creating a new configuration file at `app/biome.json`, and put there the shared options:

<CodeBlockHeader filename="app/biome.json" />

```json
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "lineWidth": 120
  }
}
```

Now let's **move** `app/frontend/biome.json` to `app/frontend/legacy-app/`, because that's where we need to use a different formatting.

<CodeBlockHeader filename="app/frontend/legacy-app/biome.json" />


```json
{
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space"
  }
}
```

Then, we tell Biome to inherit all the options from the main `app/biome.json` file, using the `extends` property:

<CodeBlockHeader filename="app/frontend/legacy-app/biome.json" />

```diff
{
+  "extends": ["../../app.json"],
   "formatter": {
     "indentStyle": "space"
   }
}
```

Let's jump to `app/backend/biome.json`, where we need to enable the linting:

<CodeBlockHeader filename="app/backend/biome.json" />

```json
{
  "extends": ["../app.json"],
    "linter": {
      "enabled": "true",
      "rules": {
        "recommended": true
      }
   }
}
```
