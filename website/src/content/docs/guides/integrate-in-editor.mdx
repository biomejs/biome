title: Integrate Biome in your editor
description: Learn how you can integrate Biome with editors and IDEs
---

## First-party plugins

These are plugins that are maintained by the Biome team and part of the [Biome organization](https://github.com/biomejs).

### VS Code

The Biome editor integration allows you to:

* Format files on save or when issuing the Format command.
* Lint files and apply code fixes

Install our official [Biome VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

To make Biome the default formatter open a [supported file](/internals/language-support/) and:

* open the *Command Palette* (View or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd title="Cmd">⌘</kbd>+<kbd title="Shift">⇧</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>)
* select  *Format Document With...*
* select *Configure Default Formatter*
* select *Biome*.

### IntelliJ

To install the Biome IntelliJ plugin, head over to [official plugin page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22761-biome) or follow these steps:

**From JetBrains IDEs:**

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to **Settings/Preferences**.
3. Select **Plugins** from the left-hand menu.
4. Click on the **Marketplace** tab.
5. Search for "Biome" and click **Install**.
6. Restart the IDE to activate the plugin.

**From disk:**

1. Download the plugin .zip from releases tab.
2. Press `⌘Сmd,` to open the IDE settings and then select Plugins.
3. On the Plugins page, click The Settings button and then click Install Plugin from Disk….

## Third-party plugins

These are plugin maintained by other communities, that you install in your editor:
- [`neovim`](https://neovim.io/): you'll have to install [`nvim-lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/), and follow the [instructions](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#biome);
- [`helix`](https://helix-editor.com/): follow the instruction of [this manual](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/editors/helix/manual.md)
- [`coc-biome`](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-biome): Biome extension for [`coc.nvim`](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)
- [`sublime text`](https://www.sublimetext.com/): follow the [`LSP-biome`](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-biome) installation instructions
- [`Emacs`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): ensure you have [`lsp-mode`](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) installed, follow the [`lsp-biome`](https://github.com/cxa/lsp-biome) installation instructions to enable Biome support in `lsp-mode`

## Write your own plugin

Biome has [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) first-class support. If your editor does implement LSP, then the integration of Biome should be seamless.

### Use the LSP proxy

Biome has a command called `lsp-proxy`. When executed, Biome will spawn two processes:
- a [daemon](/internals/architecture#daemon) that does execute the requested operations;
- a server that functions as a proxy between the requests of the client - the editor - and the server - the daemon;

If your editor is able to interact with a server and send [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) request, you only need to configure the editor run that command.

You can check how the [`neo-vim biome plugin`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/biome.lua) does it.

### Use `stdin`

If your editor doesn't support LSP, you use directly the binary `biome` and call it using [standard input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)).

The following commands can be called via standard input:
- [`format`](/reference/cli/#biome-format)
- [`lint`](/reference/cli/#biome-lint)
- [`check`](/reference/cli/#biome-check)

Biome will return the new output (or the original output if changes haven't occurred) to [standard output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)) and the diagnostics to [standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)).

When you use `stdin`, you must pass the `--stdin-file-path` option. The file `path` **doesn't need to exist** in your file system, it can be any name. **What's important** is to provide the correct file extension, so Biome knows **how to treat** your file.

It's the editor's responsibility to locate the resolve the path of the binary and then call it when it's needed. The binaries are shipped to npm based on the architectures and OS that we support:

- `@biomejs/cli-darwin-arm64`
- `@biomejs/cli-darwin-x64`
- `@biomejs/cli-linux-arm64`
- `@biomejs/cli-linux-x64`
- `@biomejs/cli-win32-arm64`
- `@biomejs/cli-win32-x64`

The binary name is `biome` or `biome.exe`, and it can be found in the root directory of the library, e.g.: `@biomejs/cli-darwin-arm64/biome`, `@biomejs/cli-win32-x64/biome.exe`.

### Use the daemon with the binary

Using the binary via CLI is very efficient, although you won't be able to provide [logs](#daemon-logs) to your users. The CLI allows you to bootstrap a daemon and then use the CLI commands through the daemon itself.

If order to do so, you first need to start a daemon process with the [`start`](/reference/cli#biome-start) command:

```shell
biome start
```
Then, every command needs to add the `--use-server` options, e.g.:

```shell
echo "console.log('')" | biome format --use-server --stdin-file-path=dummy.js
```

:::note
If you decide to use the daemon, you're also responsible to restart/kill the process with the [`stop`](/reference/cli#biome-stop) command, to avoid having ghost processes.
:::

:::caution
Operations via the daemon are significantly slower than the CLI itself, so it's advised to run operations only on single files.
:::

### Daemon logs

The Biome daemon saves logs in your file system. Logs are stored in a folder called `biome-logs`. The path of  this folder changes based on your operative system:
-  Linux: `~/.cache/biome`;
-  Windows: `C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\biomejs\biome\cache`
-  macOS: `/Users/<UserName>/Library/Caches/dev.biomejs.biome`

For other operative systems, you can find the folder in the system's temporary directory.

To obtain the precise path, execute the following command:
```shell
biome explain daemon-logs
```

The log files are rotated on an hourly basis.
