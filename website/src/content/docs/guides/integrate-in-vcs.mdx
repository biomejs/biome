title: Integrate Biome with your VCS
description: Learn how you can integrate Biome with VCS
---

The VCS (Version Control System) integration is meant to take advantage of **additional** features that only a VCS can provide, allowing to customise
your development experience even further.

The integration is *opt-in**, and it requires two mandatory fields. The `vcs.enabled` field, and the `vcs.clientKind` field, both in the configuration file:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientKind": "git"
  }
}
```

This configuration doesn't do **anything per se**. You have to opt-in new features.

### Use the ignore file

This is a feature that allows Biome to read the ignore file of the VCS and ignore all the files and folders that were specified in it. This is an opt-in feature, and you have to enable the `vcs.useIgnoreFile` field:

```json title="biome.json" ins={5}
{
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientKind": "git",
    "useIgnoreFile": true
  }
}
```

### Process only changed files

This is a feature that is available only via CLI, and allows to process **only** the files that **changed** from one revision and another.

First, you have to update your configuration file and tell Biome what's the default branch via `vcs.defaultBranch` field:

```json title="biome.json" ins={6}
{
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientKind": "git",
    "useIgnoreFile": true,
    "defaultBranch": "main"
  }
}
```

Then, add the `--changed` option to your command, to process only those files that your VCS acknowledged as "changed". Biome, with the help of the VCS, will determine the changed file from the branch `main` and your current revision:

```shell
biome format --changed
```

:::caution
Biome doesn't check what's changed, this means that even adding spaces or newlines to a file, will mark this file as "changed"
:::

Alternatively, you can use the option `--since` to specify an arbitrary branch. This option **takes precedence** over the option `vcs.defaultBranch`. For example, you might want to check your changes against the `next` branch:

```shell
biome format --changed --since=next
```
