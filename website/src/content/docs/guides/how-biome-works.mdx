This is a guide that explains how the tool works, assumptions, and internal information useful when setting up the project and the configuration file.

## Configuration

The configuration file is considered **optional**, Biome has good defaults. Use the configuration
file to change those defaults.

The Biome configuration file is named `biome.json` and should be placed in the root directory of your project. The root
directory is usually the directory containing your project's `package.json`.

Since version `1.6.0`, Biome accepts also the file `biome.jsonc`.

:::note
If both `biome.json` and `biome.jsonc` are present in the same folder, the priority will be given to `biome.json`
:::

This configuration file enables the formatter and sets the preferred indent style and width. The linter is disabled:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "indentStyle": "tab",
    "lineWidth": 120
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

### Default configuration

When you run `biome init`, the default configuration emitted is the following:

<DefaultConfiguration />

### Configuration file resolution

Biome uses auto discovery to find the nearest `biome.json` file. It starts looking for `biome.json` in the current
working directory, and then it starts looking in the parent directories until:
- it finds a `biome.json` file;
- it applies Biome's defaults if **no `biome.json` is found**;

Here's an example:

<FileTree>
- app
  - backend
    - package.json
    - biome.json
  - frontend
    - legacy
      - package.json
    - new
      - package.json
    - biome.json
</FileTree>

- biome commands that run in `app/backend/package.json` will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`;
- biome commands that run in `app/frontend/legacy/package.json` and `app/frontend/new/package.json`
will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`;

:::note
Most biome commands also support the `--config-path` command line option to point to a custom directory for the `biome.json` file. In this case, the above configuration file resolution is **disabled**.
:::

### The `extends` option

The `extends` option allows to break down a configuration in multiple file and "share" common patterns among multiple projects/folders.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.6.0/schema.json",
  "extends": ["./formatter.json", "./linter.json"]
}
```

```json title="formatter.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.6.0/schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "indentSize": 2
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "semicolons": "asNeeded"
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="linter.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.6.0/schema.json",
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "complexity": {
        "noUselessConstructor": "off"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The files defined in this array:
- must exist in the file system;
- are resolved from the path where the `biome.json` file is defined;
- must be relative paths. Paths to libraries are not resolved;
- must be reachable by Biome, e.g. symbolic links might not be resolved by Biome;
- will be processed in order: from the first one to the last one;
- can override the same properties, but ultimately only the last one will be used by Biome;


#### Import `biome.json` from a library

From version `v1.6.0`, Biome is able to resolve configuration files from `node_modules/`, so you can export your configuration file from a library, and import it in multiple projects.

In order to do so, the first thing to do is to set up your "shared" Biome configuration in a certain way. Let's suppose that your library is called `@org/shared-configs`, and you want to import the Biome configuration using the specifier `@org/shared-configs/biome`. You have to set up the `package.json` is a specific way:

```json title="package.json" ins={5,3}
{
  "name": "@org/shared-configs",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    "./biome": "./biome.json"
  }
}
```

:::note
You can also export `biome.jsonc` files. Just change `./biome.json` to `./biome.jsonc` and it should work.
:::

Make sure that `@org/shared-configs` is correctly installed in your project, and update the `biome.json` file to look like the following snippet:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["@org/shared-configs/biome"]
}
```

Biome will attempt to **resolve** your library `@org/shared-configs/` from your working directory. The working directory is:
- when using the CLI, the directory where you execute your scripts from. Usually it matches the location of your `package.json` file;
- when using the LSP, the root directory of your project.

:::caution
To avoid a breaking change with how the existing resolution works, paths that start with a dot `.` or contains `.json`/`.jsonc` in their name, they **won't** be resolved from `node_modules/`.
:::

For more information about the resolution algorithm, read the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-and-loading-algorithm).

## Protected Files

The following files are currently ignored by Biome. This means that no diagnostics will be ever emitted by Biome for those files.

- `composer.lock`
- `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `yarn.lock`

The following files are parsed as **`JSON` files** with  the options `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `true`. This is because editor tools like VSCode treat them like this.

- `.babelrc.json`
- `.babelrc`
- `.ember-cli`
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.eslintrc`
- `.hintrc`
- `.jsfmtrc`
- `.jshintrc`
- `.swcrc`
- `babel.config.json`
- `jsconfig.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `tslint.json`
- `typedoc.json`
- `typescript.json`

## `include` and `ignore` explained

Biome will resolve the globs specified in `include` and `ignore` relatively from the working directory.

The working directory is the directory where you usually run a CLI command.
This means that you have to place **particular attention** when the configuration file is placed in
a different directory from where you execute your command.

For example, you have a project that contains two directories called `backend/` and `frontend/`,
and decide to place your `biome.json` at the root folder of the project.
Inside the `frontend/` project, you have your `package.json` with some scripts that run Biome:

<FileTree>
- backend
  - ...
- biome.json
- frontend
  - package.json
  - src
    - ...
  - test
    - ...
</FileTree>

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "include": ["src/**/*.js", "src/**/*.ts"]
  },
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space"
  }
}
```

```json title="frontend/package.json"
{
  "name": "frontend-project",
  "scripts": {
    "format": "biome format --write ./"
  }
}
```

When you run the script `format` inside `frontend/package.json`,
the working directory resolved by that script will be `frontend/`,
the globs `src/**/*.js` and `src/**/*.ts` will have as "base" directory `frontend/`.

Although `include` doesn't contain `test`, Biome will still traverse the folder.
This i

:::note
`include` and `ignore` have a slightly different semantics.
`ignore` applies to both regular files and folders,
while `include` is only tested on regular files.
This means that if you want to prevent Biome from traversing a folder,
you have to add the folder to `ignore`.
This is a current limitation that we will fix in a future release.
:::

:::caution
`ignore` and `include` inside `overrides` have a **different** semantics:
- for `ignore`: if a file matches the globs, **_don't_ apply** the configuration inside this override, and keep apply the next overrides;
- for `include`: if a file matches the globs, **apply** the configuration inside this override, and keep apply the next overrides;

### Glob syntax explained


The syntax and meaning of these two options loosely follow the [globset rules](https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/#syntax) but without the ability to set options.


> - `*` matches zero or more characters.
> - `**` recursively matches directories but are only legal in three situations.
> First, if the glob starts with <code>\*\*&#x2F;</code>, then it matches
> all directories. For example, <code>\*\*&#x2F;foo</code> matches `foo`
> and `bar/foo` but not `foo/bar`. Secondly, if the glob ends with
> <code>&#x2F;\*\*</code>, then it matches all sub-entries. For example,
  > <code>foo&#x2F;\*\*</code> matches `foo/a` and `foo/a/b`, but not `foo`.
  > Thirdly, if the glob contains <code>&#x2F;\*\*&#x2F;</code> anywhere within
  > the pattern, then it matches zero or more directories. Using `**` anywhere
  > else is illegal (N.B. the glob `**` is allowed and means "match everything").
>
> - Metacharacters such as `*` and `?` can be escaped with character class
> notation. e.g., `[*]` matches `*`.
