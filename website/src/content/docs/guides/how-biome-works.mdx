import DefaultConfiguration from "@/components/generated/DefaultConfiguration.mdx";
import {FileTree} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This is a guide that explains how the tool works, assumptions, and internal information useful when setting up the project and the configuration file.

## Configuration

The configuration file is considered **optional**, Biome has good defaults. Use the configuration
file to change those defaults.

The Biome configuration file is named `biome.json` and should be placed in the root directory of your project. The root
directory is usually the directory containing your project's `package.json`.

Since version `1.6.0`, Biome accepts also the file `biome.jsonc`.

:::note
If both `biome.json` and `biome.jsonc` are present in the same folder, the priority will be given to `biome.json`
:::

This configuration file enables the formatter and sets the preferred indent style and width. The linter is disabled:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "indentStyle": "tab",
    "lineWidth": 120
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

### Default configuration

When you run `biome init`, the default configuration emitted is the following:

<DefaultConfiguration/>

### Configuration file resolution

Biome uses auto discovery to find the nearest configuration file. It starts looking for one in the current
working directory, and then it starts looking in the parent directories until:
- it finds a `biome.json` or a `biome.jsonc` file;
- it applies Biome's defaults if **no configuration file is found**;

Here's an example:

<FileTree>
- app
  - backend
    - package.json
    - biome.json
  - frontend
    - legacy
      - package.json
    - new
      - package.json
    - biome.json
</FileTree>


- Biome commands that run in `app/backend/package.json` will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`;
- Biome commands that run in `app/frontend/legacy/package.json` and `app/frontend/new/package.json`
will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`;

:::note
Most Biome commands support using the `--config-path` command line option. This allows you to specify a custom configuration file or a directory where Biome can look for a `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc` file. When you use `--config-path`, the standard configuration file resolution process is **disabled**.

If `--config-path` points directly to a file, you can use names other than `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`. Biome will read a `.json` file using a standard JSON parser. For files with other extensions, Biome will treat them as `.jsonc` files, using a more flexible JSON parser that allows comments and trailing commas.
:::

:::caution
Biome doesn't support nested `biome.json` files, neither in CLI nor in LSP. [Follow and help the support in the relative issue](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/2228)
:::

### The `extends` option

The `extends` option allows you to split your configuration across multiple files. This way, you can share common settings across different projects or folders.

Here's an example of how you might set up your `biome.json` to extend other configuration files:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.6.4/schema.json",
  "extends": ["./formatter.json", "./linter.json"]
}
```

For instance, you could define formatter settings in `formatter.json`:

```json title="formatter.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.6.4/schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "indentSize": 2
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "semicolons": "asNeeded"
    }
  }
}
```

And linter rules in `linter.json`:

```json title="linter.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.6.4/schema.json",
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "complexity": {
        "noUselessConstructor": "off"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The entries defined in this array:
- must exist in the file system;
- are resolved from the path where the `biome.json` file is defined;
- must be relative paths or [paths to library](#extends-biomejson-from-a-library)
- must be reachable by Biome, e.g. symbolic links might not be resolved by Biome, if they are relative paths;
- are processed in the order they are listed, with settings in later files overriding earlier ones;

### Extend `biome.json` from a library

Starting from version `v1.6.0`, Biome is able to resolve configuration files from the `node_modules/` directory. So you can export your configuration file from a library, and import it in multiple projects.

In order to do so, the first thing to do is to set up your "shared" Biome configuration in a certain way. Let's suppose that your library is called `@org/shared-configs`, and you want to import the Biome configuration using the specifier `@org/shared-configs/biome`. You have to set up the `package.json` in a specific way:

```json title="package.json" ins={5,3}
{
  "name": "@org/shared-configs",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    "./biome": "./biome.json"
  }
}
```

:::note
You can also export `biome.jsonc` files. Just change `./biome.json` to `./biome.jsonc` and it should work.
:::

Make sure that `@org/shared-configs` is correctly installed in your project, and update the `biome.json` file to look like the following snippet:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "extends": ["@org/shared-configs/biome"]
}
```

Biome will attempt to **resolve** your library `@org/shared-configs/` from your working directory. The working directory is:
- when using the CLI, the directory where you execute your scripts from. Usually it matches the location of your `package.json` file;
- when using the LSP, the root directory of your project.

:::caution
To avoid a breaking change with how the existing resolution works, paths starting with a dot `.` or ending with `.json` or `.jsonc` **won't** be resolved from `node_modules/`.
:::

For more information about the resolution algorithm, refer to the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-and-loading-algorithm).

### Resolution of globs and paths

Globs and relative file paths are resolved from the working directory. The working directory is:
- in a CLI context, the directory where you run the biome command;
- in a LSP context, is the root directory

This means that if you take advantage of the [configuration file resolution](#configuration-file-resolution), you run a CLI command from a folder, and the configuration file is found in some **parent folder**, the paths/globs present on said files will be relative from where the command was run. Let's see an example:

<FileTree>
- ~home/
  - biome.json
  - www/
    - todo-app/
      - dist/
      - src/
      - package.json
</FileTree>


```json title="~home/biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "ignore": ["dist/**"]
  }
}
```

```json title="~home/www/todo-app/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "check": "biome check ./"
  }
}
```

Given the previous example, when you run the command `npm run check`, Biome will eventually find the configuration file in `~home`. Since the command was run from `~home/www/too-app`, that folder is considered the **working directory**. Biome will read the `files.ignore` option, and all those entries will be resolved from `~home/www/todo-app`.json

## Protected Files

The following files are currently ignored by Biome. This means that no diagnostics will be ever emitted by Biome for those files.

- `composer.lock`
- `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `yarn.lock`

## Well-known Files

Here are some well-known files that we specifically treat based on their file names, rather than their extensions. Currently, the well-known files are JSON-like files only, but we may broaden the list to include other types when we support new parsers.

### JSON-like Files

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with both the options `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `false`.

- `.all-contributorsrc`
- `.arcconfig`
- `.auto-changelog`
- `.bowerrc`
- `.c8rc`
- `.htmlhintrc`
- `.imgbotconfig`
- `.jslintrc`
- `.nycrc`
- `.tern-config`
- `.tern-project`
- `.vuerc`
- `.watchmanconfig`
- `mcmod.info`

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with the options `json.parser.allowComments` set to `true` but `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `false`. This is because the tools consuming these files can only strip comments.

- `.ember-cli`
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.jscsrc`
- `.jshintrc`
- `tslint.json`

The following files are parsed as `JSON` files with the options `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `true`. This is because the tools consuming these files are designed to accommodate such settings.

- `.babelrc`
- `.babelrc.json`
- `.devcontainer.json`
- `.hintrc`
- `.hintrc.json`
- `.swcrc`
- `api-documenter.json`
- `api-extractor.json`
- `babel.config.json`
- `deno.json`
- `devcontainer.json`
- `dprint.json`
- `jsconfig.json`
- `jsr.json`
- `language-configuration.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `typedoc.json`
- `typescript.json`

## `include` and `ignore` explained

Biome will resolve the globs specified in `include` and `ignore` relatively from the working directory.

The working directory is the directory where you usually run a CLI command.
This means that you have to place **particular attention** when the configuration file is placed in
a different directory from where you execute your command.

For example, you have a project that contains two directories called `backend/` and `frontend/`,
and decide to place your `biome.json` at the root folder of the project.
Inside the `frontend/` project, you have your `package.json` with some scripts that run Biome:

<FileTree>
- backend
  - ...
- biome.json
- frontend
  - package.json
  - src
    - ...
  - test
    - ...
</FileTree>


```json title="biome.json"
{
  "files": {
    "include": ["src/**/*.js", "src/**/*.ts"]
  },
  "formatter": {
    "indentStyle": "space"
  }
}
```

```json title="frontend/package.json"
{
  "name": "frontend-project",
  "scripts": {
    "format": "biome format --write ./"
  }
}
```

When you run the script `format` inside `frontend/package.json`,
the working directory resolved by that script will be `frontend/`,
the globs `src/**/*.js` and `src/**/*.ts` will have as "base" directory `frontend/`.

Although `include` doesn't contain `test`, Biome will still traverse the folder.

:::note
`include` and `ignore` have a slightly different semantics.
`ignore` applies to both regular files and folders,
while `include` is only tested on regular files.
This means that if you want to prevent Biome from traversing a folder,
you have to add the folder to `ignore`.
This is a current limitation that we will fix in a future release.
:::

:::caution
`ignore` and `include` inside `overrides` have a **different** semantics:
- for `ignore`: if a file matches the globs, **_don't_ apply** the configuration inside this override, and keep apply the next overrides;
- for `include`: if a file matches the globs, **apply** the configuration inside this override, and keep apply the next overrides;

### Glob syntax explained


The syntax and meaning of these two options loosely follow the [globset rules](https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/#syntax) but without the ability to set options.


> - `*` matches zero or more characters.- `**` recursively matches directories but are only legal in three situations.
> First, if the glob starts with <code>\*\*&#x2F;</code>, then it matches
> all directories. For example, <code>\*\*&#x2F;foo</code> matches `foo`
> and `bar/foo` but not `foo/bar`. Secondly, if the glob ends with
<code>&#x2F;\*\*</code>, then it matches all sub-entries. For example,
  > <code>foo&#x2F;\*\*</code> matches `foo/a` and `foo/a/b`, but not `foo`.
  > Thirdly, if the glob contains <code>&#x2F;\*\*&#x2F;</code> anywhere within
  > the pattern, then it matches zero or more directories. Using `**` anywhere
  > else is illegal (N.B. the glob `**` is allowed and means "match everything").- Metacharacters such as `*` and `?` can be escaped with character class
> notation. e.g., `[*]` matches `*`.
