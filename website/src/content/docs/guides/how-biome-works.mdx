import DefaultConfiguration from "@src/components/generated/DefaultConfiguration.mdx";

This is a guide that explains how the tool works, assumptions, and internal information useful when setting up the project and the configuration file.

## Configuration

The configuration file is considered **optional**, Biome has good defaults. Use the configuration
file to change those defaults.

The Biome configuration file is named `biome.json` and should be placed in the root directory of your project. The root
directory is usually the directory containing your project's `package.json`.

This configuration file enables the formatter and sets the preferred indent style and width. The linter is disabled:

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "indentStyle": "tab",
    "lineWidth": 120
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

### Default configuration

When you run `biome init`, the default configuration emitted is the following:

<DefaultConfiguration />

### Configuration file resolution

Biome uses auto discovery to find the nearest `biome.json` file. It starts looking for `biome.json` in the current
working directory, and then it starts looking in the parent directories until:
- it finds a `biome.json` file;
- it applies Biome's defaults if **no `biome.json` is found**;

Here's an example:

```
└── app
    ├── backend
    │   ├── package.json
    │   └── biome.json
    └── frontend
        ├── legacy
        │   └── package.json
        ├── new
        │   └── package.json
        └── biome.json

```

- biome commands that run in `app/backend/package.json` will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`;
- biome commands that run in `app/frontend/legacy/package.json` and `app/frontend/new/package.json`
will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`;


## Protected Files

The following files are currently ignored by Biome. This means that no diagnostics will be ever emitted by Biome for those files.

- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- `yarn.lock`
- `composer.json`
- `composer.lock`
- `typescript.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `jsconfig.json`
- `deno.json`
- `deno.jsonc`

The following files are parsed as **`JSON` files** with  the options `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `true`. This is because editor tools like VSCode treat them like this.

- `tslint.json`
- `babel.config.json`
- `.babelrc.json`
- `.ember-cli`
- `typedoc.json`
- `.eslintrc`
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.jsfmtrc`
- `.jshintrc`
- `.swcrc`
- `.hintrc`
- `.babelrc`

## Syntax rules for `ignore` and `include`

The syntax and meaning of these two options loosely follow the [globset rules](https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/#syntax) but without the ability to set options.


> - `?` matches any single character.
> - `*` matches zero or more characters.
> - `**` recursively matches directories but are only legal in three situations.
> First, if the glob starts with <code>\*\*&#x2F;</code>, then it matches
> all directories. For example, <code>\*\*&#x2F;foo</code> matches `foo`
> and `bar/foo` but not `foo/bar`. Secondly, if the glob ends with
> <code>&#x2F;\*\*</code>, then it matches all sub-entries. For example,
  > <code>foo&#x2F;\*\*</code> matches `foo/a` and `foo/a/b`, but not `foo`.
  > Thirdly, if the glob contains <code>&#x2F;\*\*&#x2F;</code> anywhere within
  > the pattern, then it matches zero or more directories. Using `**` anywhere
  > else is illegal (N.B. the glob `**` is allowed and means "match everything").
>
> - `{a,b}` matches `a` or `b` where `a` and `b` are arbitrary glob patterns.
> (N.B. Nesting `{...}` is not currently allowed.)
> - `[ab]` matches `a` or `b` where `a` and `b` are characters. Use
> `[!ab]` to match any character except for `a` and `b`.
> - Metacharacters such as `*` and `?` can be escaped with character class
> notation. e.g., `[*]` matches `*`.
