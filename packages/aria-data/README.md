# ARIA data

This package provides a script that extracts data from the ARIA specification.
This is a best effort approach because the ARIA specification is in a semi-structured representation.

Just call the script with the version of the ARIA specification and write t oa given file:

```shell
node generate-aria-data.js 1.2 >| aria-data-1-2.json
```
