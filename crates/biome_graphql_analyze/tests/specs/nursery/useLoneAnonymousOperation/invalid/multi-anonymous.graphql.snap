  i A GraphQL document that contains an anonymous operation (the query short-hand) is only valid if it contains only that one operation definition.
  
  i Isolate the anonymous operation in a separate document or turn into a named operation.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
