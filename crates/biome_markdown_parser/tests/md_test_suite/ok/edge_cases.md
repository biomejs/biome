#NoSpaceHeading

##AlsoNoSpace

foo --- bar is not a thematic break

inline ~~~ tilde is not a fence

    *code with* inline markers

    more code **here** too

#	Tab after hash is valid heading

##	Multiple hashes with tab

Paragraph here
    # not heading due to 4+ spaces
    - not list due to 4+ spaces
    > not quote due to 4+ spaces
continues as paragraph

Another para
   # this IS a heading (only 3 spaces)

Para with indented fence
    ```
    not a code fence
    ```
still the same paragraph
