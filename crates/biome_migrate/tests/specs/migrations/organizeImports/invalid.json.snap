  i The import sorting was the first assist action, however Biome analyzer infrastructure wasn't mature enough, so it was exposed as a standalone tool. The infrastructure is now ready to welcome it as an assist action.
  
  i Safe fix: Remove the old configuration, and turn off the relative assist action.
