<!-- should not generate diagnostics -->

<!--
	For this rule, we treat v-binds as if they fully satisfy all conditions of the rule (both presence and validity of the "type" attribute).
	This is because its non trivial to determine the value of the "type" attribute when using v-bind, and we favor having a false negative over a false positive.

<button v-bind:type="foo">submit</button>
<button :type="foo">submit</button>

<!-- We also should not flag components, only HTML elements -->
<Button>submit</Button>
