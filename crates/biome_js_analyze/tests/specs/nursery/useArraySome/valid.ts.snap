# Input
```ts
/* should not generate diagnostics */

// Should not trigger on other methods
[1, 2, 3].some(x => x > 1);

// Should not trigger on length comparisons that are not existence checks
[1, 2, 3].filter(x => x > 1).length > 1;
[1, 2, 3].filter(x => x > 1).length === 2;

// Should not trigger on .find() when the result is used (not just for existence)
const x = [1, 2, 3].find(x => x > 1) || 0;
const y = [1, 2, 3].find(x => x > 1) ?? 0;

// Should not trigger on comparisons with other values
[1, 2, 3].findIndex(x => x > 1) === 0;
[1, 2, 3].findIndex(x => x > 1) < 0; // This is actually equivalent to !some, but unicorn only specifies !== -1 and > -1 for positive existence
