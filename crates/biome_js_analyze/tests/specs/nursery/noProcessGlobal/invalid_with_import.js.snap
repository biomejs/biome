invalid_with_import.js:4:11 lint/nursery/noProcessGlobal  FIXABLE  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i Usage of the `process` global is discouraged.

    3 │ 
  > 4 │ const c = process.env;
      │           ^^^^^^^
  
  i `process` global is hard for tools to statically analyze, so code should not assume they are available.
  
  i Safe fix: Add `import process from "node:process";` to this file's imports.
