invalid.js:2:29 lint/nursery/noDivRegex  FIXABLE  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i Avoid using an equal sign directly after the slash at the beginning of a regular expression literal.
  
    1 │ /* should generate diagnostics */
  > 2 │ var f = function() { return /=foo/; };
      │                             ^^^^^^
    3 │ 
  
  i The characters /= can be confused with a division assignment operator. Replace the equal sign (=) with [=] to prevent confusion.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
  
  i Safe fix: Replace with [=].
