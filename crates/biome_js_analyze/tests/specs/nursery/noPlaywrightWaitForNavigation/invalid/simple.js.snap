  i waitForNavigation() is deprecated. Use page.waitForURL() or page.waitForLoadState() instead.
  
  i These alternatives are more reliable and provide better control over navigation waiting.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
