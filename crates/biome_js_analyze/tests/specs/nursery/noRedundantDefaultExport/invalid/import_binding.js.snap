import_binding.js:3:16 lint/nursery/noRedundantDefaultExport ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ! Default export exports the same symbol as a named export.
  
    1 │ import foo from "./other";
    2 │ export { foo };
  > 3 │ export default foo;
      │                ^^^
  
  i Exporting the same identifier as both a named export and a default export is redundant.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
