named_default.js:3:10 lint/nursery/noRedundantDefaultExport ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ! Default export exports the same symbol as a named export.
  
    1 │ const foo = 1;
    2 │ 
  > 3 │ export { foo as default };
      │          ^^^^
    4 │ export { foo };
  
  i Exporting the same identifier as both a named export and a default export is redundant.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
