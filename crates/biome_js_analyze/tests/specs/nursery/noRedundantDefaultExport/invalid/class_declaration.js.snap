class_declaration.js:2:16 lint/nursery/noRedundantDefaultExport ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ! Default export exports the same symbol as a named export.
  
    1 │ export class MyClass {}
  > 2 │ export default MyClass;
      │                ^^^^^^^
  
  i Exporting the same identifier as both a named export and a default export is redundant.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
