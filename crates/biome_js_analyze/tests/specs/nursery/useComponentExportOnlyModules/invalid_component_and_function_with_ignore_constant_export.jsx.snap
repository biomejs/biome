invalid_component_and_function_with_ignore_constant_export.jsx:1:14 lint/nursery/useComponentExportOnlyModules ━━━━━━━━━━

  i Exporting a non-component with components is not allowed.
  
  > 1 │ export const foo = () => {}
      │              ^^^
    2 │ export const Bar = () => {}
  
  i Fast Refresh only works when a file only exports components.
  
  i Consider separating non-component exports into a new file.
  
  i If it is a component, it may not be following the variable naming conventions.
