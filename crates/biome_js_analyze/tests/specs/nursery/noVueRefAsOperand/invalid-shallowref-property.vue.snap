  i Without `.value`, Vue cannot track changes to the ref, which may break reactivity.
  
  i Use `.value` to access ref value.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
