# Input
```js
// These should trigger with low entropy threshold
const mediumEntropy1 = "abc123def456ghi";
const mediumEntropy2 = "user2024Password";
const mediumEntropy3 = "SecretKey123ABC";
const mediumEntropy4 = "TokenXyZ98765";

  i Type of secret detected: Detected high entropy string
  
  i Storing secrets in source code is a security risk. Consider the following steps:
    1. Remove the secret from your code. If you've already committed it, consider removing the commit entirely from your git tree.
    2. If needed, use environment variables or a secure secret management system to store sensitive data.
    3. If this is a false positive, consider adding an inline disable comment, or tweak the entropy threshold. See options in our docs.
    This rule only catches basic vulnerabilities. For more robust, proper solutions, check out our recommendations at: https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-secrets/#recommendations
