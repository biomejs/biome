// This one might be surprising, since we're clearly destructuring props!
// But this will be caught as a reactive expression use outside of
// a tracked scope, in the "solid/reactivity" rule. There's really
// nothing wrong with destructuring props in tracked scopes when done
// correctly, but catching it in the params covers the most common
// cases with good DX.
