dollar-dollar.js:2:23 lint/nursery/noPlaywrightElementHandle ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i Unexpected use of element handles.
  
    1 │ /* should generate diagnostics */
  > 2 │ const buttons = await page.$$('.btn');

  i Element handles like page.$$() are discouraged.
  
  i Use page.locator() or other locator methods like getByRole() instead.
  
  i Locators auto-wait and are more reliable than element handles.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
