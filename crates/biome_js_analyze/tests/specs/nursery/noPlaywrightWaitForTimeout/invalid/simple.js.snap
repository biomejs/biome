  i Hardcoded timeouts are flaky and make tests slower. Use conditions that wait for specific events.
  
  i Prefer using built-in wait methods like page.waitForLoadState(), page.waitForURL(), or page.waitForFunction() instead.
  
  i Consider using web-first assertions like expect(locator).toBeVisible() which auto-wait for conditions.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
