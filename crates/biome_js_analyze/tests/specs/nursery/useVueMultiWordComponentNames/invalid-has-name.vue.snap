  i Single-word component names can collide with HTML elements and are less descriptive.
  
  i Rename the component to have 2 or more words (e.g. "FooItem", or "BarView").
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
