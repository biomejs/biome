  i This variable shadows another variable with the same name in the outer scope.
  
    1 │ type T = 1;
  > 2 │ function foo<T>(arg: T) {}
      │              ^
    3 │ 
  
  i This is the shadowed variable, which is now inaccessible in the inner scope.
  
  > 1 │ type T = 1;
      │      ^
    2 │ function foo<T>(arg: T) {}
    3 │ 
  
  i Consider renaming this variable. It's easy to confuse the origin of variables if they share the same name.
