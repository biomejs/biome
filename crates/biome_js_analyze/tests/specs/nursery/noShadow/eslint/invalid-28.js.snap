  i This variable shadows another variable with the same name in the outer scope.
  
  > 1 │ class C { static { let a; { let a; } } }
      │                                 ^

  i This is the shadowed variable, which is now inaccessible in the inner scope.
  
  > 1 │ class C { static { let a; { let a; } } }
      │                        ^
