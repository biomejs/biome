invalid-25.js:1:31 lint/nursery/noShadow ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i This variable shadows another variable with the same name in the outer scope.
  
  > 1 │ class A { constructor() { var A; } }
      │                               ^
    2 │ 
  
  i This is the shadowed variable, which is now inaccessible in the inner scope.
  
  > 1 │ class A { constructor() { var A; } }
      │       ^
    2 │ 
  
  i Consider renaming this variable. It's easy to confuse the origin of variables if they share the same name.
