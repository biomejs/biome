invalid-10.js:1:7 lint/nursery/noShadow ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i This variable shadows another variable with the same name in the outer scope.
  
  > 1 │ { let a; } function a() {}
      │       ^
    2 │ 
  
  i This is the shadowed variable, which is now inaccessible in the inner scope.
  
  > 1 │ { let a; } function a() {}
      │                     ^
    2 │ 
  
  i Consider renaming this variable. It's easy to confuse the origin of variables if they share the same name.
