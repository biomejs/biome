  i This is the shadowed variable, which is now inaccessible in the inner scope.

  i Consider renaming this variable. It's easy to confuse the origin of variables if they share the same name.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
