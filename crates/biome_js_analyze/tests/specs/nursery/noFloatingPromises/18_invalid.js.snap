18_invalid.js:4:13 lint/nursery/noFloatingPromises ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i A "floating" Promise was found, meaning it is not properly handled and could lead to ignored errors or unexpected behavior.
  
    2 │     get foo() {
    3 │         if (!this.initialised) {
  > 4 │             this.initialise();
      │             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    5 │             return "foo";
    6 │         }
  
  i This happens when a Promise is not awaited, lacks a `.catch` or `.then` rejection handler, or is not explicitly ignored using the `void` operator.
