12_invalid.ts:2:1 lint/nursery/noFloatingPromises ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i A "floating" Promise was found, meaning it is not properly handled and could lead to ignored errors or unexpected behavior.
  
    1 │ const [result] = [(() => Promise.reject("destructuring bypass"))()];
  > 2 │ result
      │ ^^^^^^
    3 │ 
  
  i This happens when a Promise is not awaited, lacks a `.catch` or `.then` rejection handler, or is not explicitly ignored using the `void` operator.
  

```
