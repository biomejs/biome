  i Although the Options API is still supported by Vue, using the Composition API is recommended, and makes it possible to use Vue's Vapor mode for better performance.
  
  i Use <script setup> or defineComponent with a function signature to use the Composition API instead.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
