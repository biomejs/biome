# Input
```js
// Visibility modifiers are taken from the original symbol definition, so the
// re-exports here should preserve the visibility of the symbols they are
// re-exporting.
//
// In theory, we could imagine a re-export overruling the visibility by adding
// its own annotation, but this is not something we support (at least not yet).
//
// Note that re-exporting of package private symbols will implicitly widen the
// scope from where they may be imported.
export { fooDefaultVariable, fooPackageVariable, fooPrivateVariable, fooPublicVariable } from "./foo"

```
