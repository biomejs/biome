function MyComponent25() {
    const [calc, setCalc] = useState(0);
    // Built-in hooks such as `useEffect()` normally only get validated when
    // they're imported from the "react" library. Explicitly configuring them
    // in the hooks array (as if they are user-provided hooks) overrides this.
