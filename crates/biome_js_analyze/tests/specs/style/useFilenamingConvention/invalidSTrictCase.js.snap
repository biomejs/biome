invalidSTrictCase.js lint/style/useFilenamingConvention ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ! The filename is in camelCase, however, two consecutive uppercase characters are not allowed because `strictCase` is set to `true`.
  
  i If you want to use consecutive uppercase characters in camelCase then consider setting `strictCase` option to `false`.
     Check rule options for more information.
