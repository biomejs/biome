invalid2.ts:1:13 lint/style/useEnumInitializers  FIXABLE  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ! This enum declaration contains members that are implicitly initialized.
  
  > 1 │ export enum Color {
      │             ^^^^^
    2 │     Red = "Red",
    3 │     Green = "Green",
  
  i This enum member should be explicitly initialized.
  
    2 │     Red = "Red",
    3 │     Green = "Green",
  > 4 │     Blue,
      │     ^^^^
    5 │ }
    6 │ 
  
  i Allowing implicit initializations for enum members can cause bugs if enum declarations are modified over time.
  
  i Safe fix: Initialize all enum members.
