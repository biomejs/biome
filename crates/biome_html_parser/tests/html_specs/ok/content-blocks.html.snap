## Input

```html
This document is meant to contain 2 text blocks. This is the first text block,
and the following will be the second text block. The content of this block is
intentionally long so that it line breaks.

We define the separation of "blocks" of text to be 2 line breaks, or 1 empty
line between them. This is to make it easier for users to suppress formatting
for specific blocks, while still preserving whitespace sensitivity. Despite
this, the formatter can and will combine separate blocks of content. This is
just a concept for the parser to handle.
