package.json:6:5 lint/suspicious/noDuplicateDependencies ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ! The dependency "foo" is listed twice under dependencies.
  
    4 │     "foo": "",
    5 │     "bar": "",
  > 6 │     "foo": ""
      │     ^^^^^
    7 │   }
    8 │ }
  
  i The dependency is also specified here.
  
    2 │   "name": "invalid-dependencies",
    3 │   "dependencies": {
  > 4 │     "foo": "",
      │     ^^^^^
    5 │     "bar": "",
    6 │     "foo": ""
  
  i This can lead to package manager issues and confusion for other developers. To resolve this, remove one of the listings.
