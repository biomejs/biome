# sort-package-json Test Suite

These tests are ported from the sort-package-json npm package to ensure 100% compatibility with the authoritative implementation.

**Source**: https://github.com/keithamus/sort-package-json
**Tests ported from**: `/tests/snapshots/*.md`

Each test case verifies that our implementation produces identical behavior to sort-package-json for specific features and edge cases.

## Test Organization

All tests are organized in a flat structure with descriptive names using `<category>_<feature>` pattern.
Each test is in its own directory with `package.json` and snapshots generated by `cargo insta test`.

## Coverage

Tests cover all major features:
- Field ordering and transformations
- Dependency sorting (npm vs yarn/pnpm)
- Script sorting with lifecycle hooks
- Export condition sorting
- ESLint and Prettier config sorting
- Array transformations (contributors, badges)
- Deep recursive sorting
