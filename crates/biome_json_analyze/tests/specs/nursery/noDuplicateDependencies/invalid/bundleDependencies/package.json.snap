  i The dependency "foo" is listed twice under bundleDependencies.
  
    4 │     "foo",
    5 │     "bar",
  > 6 │     "foo"
      │     ^^^^^
    7 │   ]
    8 │ }
  
  i The dependency is also specified here.
  
    2 │   "name": "invalid-bundle-dependencies",
    3 │   "bundleDependencies": [
  > 4 │     "foo",
      │     ^^^^^
    5 │     "bar",
    6 │     "foo"
  
  i This can lead to package manager issues and confusion for other developers. To resolve this, remove one of the listings.
