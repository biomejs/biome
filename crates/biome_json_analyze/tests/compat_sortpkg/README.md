This directory contains compatibility test data from the sort-package-json npm package.

The data.json file was generated from the sort-package-json test suite using the script available at https://gist.github.com/arthurfiorette/eaedd936f44b621435a1c0ed89d3f10c

Each test case contains an input and expected output JSON structure that verifies our organizePackageJson implementation produces identical results to the authoritative sort-package-json implementation.
