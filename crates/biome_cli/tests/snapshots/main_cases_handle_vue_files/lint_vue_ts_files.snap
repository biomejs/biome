file.vue:1:3 lint/suspicious/noDoubleEquals  FIXABLE  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  × Use === instead of ==
  
  > 1 │ a == b;
      │   ^^
    2 │ delete a.c;
    3 │ 
  
  i == is only allowed when comparing against null
  
  > 1 │ a == b;
      │   ^^
    2 │ delete a.c;
    3 │ 
  
  i Using === may be unsafe if you are relying on type coercion
  
  i Unsafe fix: Use ===
  
    1 │ a·===·b;

```block
file.vue:2:1 lint/performance/noDelete  FIXABLE  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  × Avoid the delete operator which can impact performance.
  
    1 │ a == b;
  > 2 │ delete a.c;
      │ ^^^^^^^^^^
    3 │ 
    4 │ var foo: string = "";
  
  i Unsafe fix: Use an undefined assignment instead.
  
    1 1 │   a == b;

    3 3 │   
    4 4 │   var foo: string = "";

```block
file.vue:4:8 lint/style/noInferrableTypes  FIXABLE  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  × This type annotation is trivially inferred from its initialization.
  
    2 │ delete a.c;
    3 │ 
  > 4 │ var foo: string = "";
      │        ^^^^^^^^
    5 │ 
  
  i Safe fix: Remove the type annotation.
  
    4 │ var·foo:·string·=·"";
      │        --------      

```

```block
file.vue:4:1 lint/style/noVar  FIXABLE  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  × Use let or const instead of var.
  
    2 │ delete a.c;
    3 │ 
  > 4 │ var foo: string = "";
      │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    5 │ 
  
  i A variable declared with var is accessible in the whole module. Thus, the variable can be accessed before its initialization and outside the block where it is declared.
  
  i See MDN web docs for more details.
  
  i Unsafe fix: Use 'const' instead.
