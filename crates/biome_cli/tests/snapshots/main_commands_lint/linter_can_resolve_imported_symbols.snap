```block
src/index.ts:5:1 lint/nursery/noFloatingPromises ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i A "floating" Promise was found, meaning it is not properly handled and could lead to ignored errors or unexpected behavior.
  
    3 │ fn(foo());
    4 │ 
  > 5 │ bar();
      │ ^^^^^^
  
  i This happens when a Promise is not awaited, lacks a `.catch` or `.then` rejection handler, or is not explicitly ignored using the `void` operator.
