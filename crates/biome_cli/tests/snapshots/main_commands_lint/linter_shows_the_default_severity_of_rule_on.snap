      │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
  i A variable declared with var is accessible in the whole module. Thus, the variable can be accessed before its initialization and outside the block where it is declared.
  
  i See MDN web docs for more details.
  
  i Unsafe fix: Use 'const' instead.
  
  - var·name·=·'tobias'
