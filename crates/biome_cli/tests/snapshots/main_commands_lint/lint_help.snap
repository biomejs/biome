Run various checks on a set of files.

Usage: lint [--apply] [--apply-unsafe] [PATH]...

Set of properties to integrate Biome with a VCS software.
        --vcs-client-kind=<git>  The kind of client.
        --vcs-enabled=<true|false>  Whether Biome should integrate itself with the VCS client
        --vcs-use-ignore-file=<true|false>  Whether Biome should use the VCS ignore file. When [true],
                              Biome will ignore the files specified in the ignore file.
        --vcs-root=PATH       The folder where Biome should check for VCS files. By default, Biome will
                              use the same folder where `biome.json` was found.
                              If Biome can't find the configuration, it will attempt to use the current
                              working directory. If no current working directory can't be found, Biome
                              won't use the VCS integration, and a diagnostic will be emitted

The configuration of the filesystem
        --files-max-size=NUMBER  The maximum allowed size for source code files in bytes. Files above
                              this limit will be ignored for performance reasons. Defaults to 1 MiB
        --files-ignore-unknown=<true|false>  Tells Biome to not emit diagnostics when handling files
                              that doesn't know

Global options applied to all commands
        --colors=<off|force>  Set the formatting mode for markup: "off" prints everything as plain text,
                              "force" forces the formatting of markup using ANSI even if the console
                              output is determined to be incompatible
        --use-server          Connect to a running instance of the Biome daemon server.
        --verbose             Print additional verbose advices on diagnostics
        --config-path=PATH    Set the filesystem path to the directory of the biome.json configuration
                              file
        --max-diagnostics=NUMBER  Cap the amount of diagnostics displayed.
                              [default: 20]
        --skip-errors         Skip over files containing syntax errors instead of emitting an error diagnostic.
        --no-errors-on-unmatched  Silence errors that would be emitted in case no files were processed
                              during the execution of the command.
        --error-on-warnings   Tell Biome to exit with an error code if some diagnostics emit warnings.

Available positional items:
    PATH                      Single file, single path or list of paths

Available options:
        --apply               Apply safe fixes, formatting
        --apply-unsafe        Apply safe fixes and unsafe fixes, formatting and import sorting
        --stdin-file-path=PATH  A file name with its extension to pass when reading from standard in,
                              e.g. echo 'let a;' | biome lint --stdin-file-path=file.js"
    -h, --help                Prints help information
