Run various checks on a set of files.

Usage: lint [--write] [--unsafe] [--rule=<GROUP|RULE>] [--staged] [--changed] [--since=REF] [PATH]...

Set of properties to integrate Biome with a VCS software.
        --vcs-client-kind=<git>  The kind of client.
        --vcs-enabled=<true|false>  Whether Biome should integrate itself with the VCS client
        --vcs-use-ignore-file=<true|false>  Whether Biome should use the VCS ignore file. When [true],
                              Biome will ignore the files specified in the ignore file.
        --vcs-root=PATH       The folder where Biome should check for VCS files. By default, Biome will
                              use the same folder where `biome.json` was found.
                              If Biome can't find the configuration, it will attempt to use the current
                              working directory. If no current working directory can't be found, Biome
                              won't use the VCS integration, and a diagnostic will be emitted
        --vcs-default-branch=BRANCH  The main branch of the project

The configuration of the filesystem
        --files-max-size=NUMBER  The maximum allowed size for source code files in bytes. Files above
                              this limit will be ignored for performance reasons. Defaults to 1 MiB
        --files-ignore-unknown=<true|false>  Tells Biome to not emit diagnostics when handling files
                              that doesn't know

Linter options specific to the JavaScript linter
        --javascript-linter-enabled=<true|false>  Control the linter for JavaScript (and its super languages)
                              files.

Linter options specific to the JSON linter
        --json-linter-enabled=<true|false>  Control the linter for JSON (and its super languages) files.

Global options applied to all commands
        --colors=<off|force>  Set the formatting mode for markup: "off" prints everything as plain text,
                              "force" forces the formatting of markup using ANSI even if the console
                              output is determined to be incompatible
        --use-server          Connect to a running instance of the Biome daemon server.
        --verbose             Print additional diagnostics, and some diagnostics show more information.
        --config-path=PATH    Set the file path to the configuration file, or the directory path to find
                              `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`. If used, it disables the default configuration
                              file resolution.
        --max-diagnostics=NUMBER  Cap the amount of diagnostics displayed.
                              [default: 20]
        --skip-errors         Skip over files containing syntax errors instead of emitting an error diagnostic.
        --no-errors-on-unmatched  Silence errors that would be emitted in case no files were processed
                              during the execution of the command.
        --error-on-warnings   Tell Biome to exit with an error code if some diagnostics emit warnings.
        --reporter=<json|json-pretty|summary>  Allows to change how diagnostics and summary are reported.
        --log-level=<none|debug|info|warn|error>  The level of logging. In order, from the most verbose
                              to the least verbose: debug, info, warn, error.
                              The value `none` won't show any logging.
                              [default: none]
        --log-kind=<pretty|compact|json>  How the log should look like.
                              [default: pretty]
        --diagnostic-level=<info|warn|error>  The level of diagnostics to show. In order, from the lowest
                              to the most important: info, warn, error. Passing `--diagnostic-level=error`
                              will cause Biome to print only diagnostics that contain only errors.
                              [default: info]

Available positional items:
    PATH                      Single file, single path or list of paths

Available options:
        --write               Writes safe fixes
        --unsafe              Allow to do unsafe fixes, should be used with `--write` or `--fix`
        --fix                 Alias for `--write`, writes safe fixes
        --apply               Alias for `--write`, writes safe fixes (deprecated, use `--write`)
        --apply-unsafe        Alias for `--write --unsafe`, writes safe and unsafe fixes (deprecated,
                              use `--write --unsafe`)
        --rule=<GROUP|RULE>   Run only the given rule or rule group.
                              The option overrides the Biome configuration file as follows:
                              - When a rule is passed, its severity level is set to `error' if it is
                              a recommended rule, or `warn' otherwise.
                              - When a rule group is passed, the `recommended` flag is enabled, but if
                              the `all` flag is enabled.
                              Example: `biome lint --rule=correctness/noUnusedVariables`
                              Example: `biome lint --rule=suspicious`
        --stdin-file-path=PATH  Use this option when you want to format code piped from `stdin`, and
                              print the output to `stdout`.
                              The file doesn't need to exist on disk, what matters is the extension of
                              the file. Based on the extension, Biome knows how to lint the code.
                              Example: `echo 'let a;' | biome lint --stdin-file-path=file.js`
        --staged              When set to true, only the files that have been staged (the ones prepared
                              to be committed) will be linted.
        --changed             When set to true, only the files that have been changed compared to your
                              `defaultBranch` configuration will be linted.
        --since=REF           Use this to specify the base branch to compare against when you're using
                              the --changed flag and the `defaultBranch` is not set in your biome.json
    -h, --help                Prints help information
