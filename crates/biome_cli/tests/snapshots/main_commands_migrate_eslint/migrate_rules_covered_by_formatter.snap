migrate ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i 2 ESLint rules found
    - 2 are obsolete because of Biome's formatter
    - 0 can be migrated to Biome's rules (run with --write to migrate)
    - 100% (2) of your ESLint rules are fully covered by Biome
      - 0% (0) via direct migration to Biome rules
  
  
  i Unsupported rules (0 incompatible with formatter, 1 made obsolete by the formatter, 1 covered by a formatter option, 0 not yet implemented, 0 unknown source):
  
  i These rules enforce behavior completely covered by the formatter (so you don't lose the functionality):
  
  - eol-last
  
  i These rules are covered by formatter options, but they require manual migration:
  
  - indent - Covered by Biome's indentWidth formatter option.
