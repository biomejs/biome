  i Test callback is missing an expect() assertion.

  i Tests without assertions may pass even when the behavior is broken.
  
  i Add an assertion using expect() to verify the expected behavior.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.

  ! Don't focus the test.

    2 │ 
  
  i The 'only' method is often used for debugging or during implementation.
  
  i Consider removing 'only' to ensure all tests are executed.
  
  i Unsafe fix: Remove focus from test.
