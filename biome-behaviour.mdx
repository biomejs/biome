# Configuration

The configuration file is considered **optional**, Biome has good defaults. Use the configuration
file to change those defaults.

The Biome configuration file is named `biome.json` and should be placed in the root directory of your project. The root
directory is usually the directory containing your project's `package.json`.

Here's an example:

<CodeBlockHeader filename="biome.json" />

```json
{
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "indentStyle": "tab",
    "lineWidth": 120
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

This configuration file enables the formatter and sets the preferred indent style and width. The linter is disabled.

## Configuration file resolution

Biome uses auto discovery to find the nearest `biome.json` file. It starts looking for `biome.json` in the current
working directory, and then it starts looking in the parent directories until:
- it finds a `biome.json` file;
- it applies Biome's defaults if **no `biome.json` is found**;

Here's an example:

```
└── app
    ├── backend
    │   ├── package.json
    │   └── biome.json
    └── frontend
        ├── legacy
        │   └── package.json
        ├── new
        │   └── package.json
        └── biome.json

```

- biome commands that run in `app/backend/package.json` will use the configuration file `app/backend/biome.json`;
- biome commands that run in `app/frontend/legacy/package.json` and `app/frontend/new/package.json`
will use the configuration file `app/frontend/biome.json`;

## Note:
The project configuration files like `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `jsconfig.json` are currently ignored by Biome. This means that no diagnostics will be ever emitted by Biome for those files.

# Known Files
Here is a list of some known files:
- `typescript.json`
<!-- - `tsconfig.json`
- `jsconfig.json` -->
- `tslint.json`
- `babel.config.json`
- `.babelrc.json`
- `.ember-cli`
- `typedoc.json`
- `.eslintrc`
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.jsfmtrc`
- `.jshintrc`
- `.swcrc`
- `.hintrc`
- `.babelrc`

It is to note that when Biome analyses these files, they are parsed as `JSON files` with `json.parser.allowComments` and `json.parser.allowTrailingCommas` set to `true`. This is because editor tools like VSCode treat them like this.
